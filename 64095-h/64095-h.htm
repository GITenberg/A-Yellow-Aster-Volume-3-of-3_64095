  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Gwen</span> lost no time in conducting her
projected series of experiments, she carried
them on conscientiously, and with an
assumption of spontaneity that gave her
husband a high opinion of her powers of
self-government. As for the results on
Gwen herself, she found them nil, she
failed in experiencing one thrill, or the
ghost of a tremor.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>She had an opportunity about this time
of judging of the effects on the situation
of a sudden danger to her husband.
They had driven into the station to meet
a parcel of books from London. They were
early, and employed their time in watching
the goings-on of an imp in human form
wrestling with its nurse at one end of
the platform.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What an inestimable blessing it would
be,” said Humphrey reflectively, “if the
Lord would be pleased to remove that
creature. Look at it, biting and screaming
like a horse!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Drew says the child is half idiotic.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If it’s not, the nurse soon will be—Phew—take
the reins!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She only knew she had them in a
bundle in her hands, and Humphrey was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>off, then there struck on her ear a crash
of sound, and through it one thin high
shriek and a long wailing.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a second her eyes floated in darkness,
then the express thundered on and she
could see a confused mass of men and
women bending down over something.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That distinct definite shriek was
awful!” Gwen found herself thinking,
with curious composure, though she knew
perfectly well that her husband had very
likely lost his life to save that of a congenital
idiot.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was only stunned, however, and
the infant had got off scot-free.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he came to her, Gwen was very
white in sheer disgust at her own want
of emotion, and Strange knew as distinctly
as if she had told him the cause of her pallor.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>He would not wait for the books, but
turned the horses’ heads homewards and
set off at a smart trot.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That amiable infant,” he said, when
they had cleared the village, “it seems,
felt itself moved to commit suicide in
order to spite its nurse; it has been a long-standing
threat, the woman says. It threw
itself on its stomach before the in-coming
train. By Jove! It was a close shave,
we only got off by the skin of our teeth!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She would have liked to touch him, to
let her eyes melt in his sight, to make
her lips tremble, but she could not for the
life of her. She knew he had acted like
a hero, but as she had known before, he
couldn’t do any other thing when the call
came; it did not seem in any way to
alter matters.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Then she began to speculate as to
what would have happened if perchance
he had <em>not</em> come off by the skin of his
teeth. She looked curiously at him and
wondered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I haven’t a notion,” she concluded at
last, and she was silent for a long time
and very pale.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Was the game worth the candle?”
she asked, as they went through the terrace
gates. “You had said a minute
before, the Lord would do well to remove
the child.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Probably not, but when a man happens
to be in a desperate hurry he can’t
stop to go all round a question. I must
go to the stables myself, there is something
wrong with Boccaccio’s off hoof. Shall I
help you up the steps—you look white?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>“No, thank you—I wish—I wish—”
she said slowly; she never finished her
sentence, but went wearily into the house
without turning her head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish to Heaven I knew what he
thinks of it all—how much he minds!”
she whispered to herself, with noiseless
passion, as soon as she got into her room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Even in this dead-level life a big thing
has come and gone, and has left me
precisely as it found me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She smote her hands together sharply,
then she rang for her maid; she dared not
be alone, her control over herself was on
its last legs.</p>

<p class='c000'>If she had looked into Strange’s den
half an hour later she might have got
some idea of how much he minded, but
he ate a good dinner and afterwards tied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>flies with a steady hand, and made several
quite decent jokes as he watched her
standing at the open window, looking with
careless interest at his work.</p>

<p class='c000'>She wore a Watteau gown of pale
primrose, with purple pansies scattered
here and there over it; she held a great
yellow fan in her hand and stood bathed
in the yellow twilight.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If I boxed her ears,” he thought, “I
wonder what she would do or say? Any
way it couldn’t hurt her more than those
devilish experiments of hers hurt me. I
have a good mind to try—if her ears
weren’t altogether so perfect I swear I
would. Ah, my good girl, you are playing
with fire!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He paused to fix a wren’s tail feather
in its place.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>“There may come a time, little fool,
when I may get tired of this game and
resort to active measures, and then you’ll
find your bit of hell,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Dann willst du weine, du liebe kleine!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In a moment of abstraction he sang it
aloud, and gave Gwen a considerable
start.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you ever sew, Gwen?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, but I can, I believe, in a
fashion.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish you would then, it might make
you look a bit human.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good gracious! I am not divine again,
am I? I thought I had shut all that away
with my white tea-gown. Perhaps you
would like to call Tolly?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, dear, no! You would not conduce
to his soul’s salvation in the least. On
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>the contrary, I was thinking you had a
marked resemblance to Lilith.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Lilith! I am flattered certainly.
I think I will go and get some work.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange laughed, and went on tying
feathers on hooks.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ha, that touched her up!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c000'>When she was half up the stairs she
stopped and stamped:</p>

<p class='c000'>“How dare he say—say with a laugh
what I won’t even dare to think!”</p>

<p class='c000'>However, she was soon back again in
her yellow twilight, but sitting this time,
and with a big bundle of coarse flannel
in her hand that she began to stitch with
demure diligence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What in the name of fortune is that!”
said Strange, after taking steady stock of it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“I don’t really know, I got it in Eliza’s
room—I think it is a jelly-bag, <a id='its'></a>it’s just
like one I once made for Mrs. Fellowes,
and spoiled disgracefully. I sewed up the
wrong end!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange investigated it with much interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My good girl,” he said at last, “do
you know what you are doing? You are
sewing an old woman’s petticoat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He gave a laugh that reached Tolly, as
he sat varnishing boots downstairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bless ’em, the pair of ’em,” he remarked,
“and as ’appy together as if they lived
in four rooms! Queer, too! as the aristocracy’s
mostly gone to the dogs in the
domestic line!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>I wonder</span> whether the fellow is grasping
the ‘high seriousness’ of Art, or going
to the devil!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange was on his road to see Brydon,
from whom that morning he had received
a rather enigmatical note.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I didn’t expect you this hour,” said
Brydon, when he arrived, “I thought it
was that brute, the fellow over me, who
always forgets his key. I came back to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>the old place, you see, from a sort of
habit, and I thought too it would suit
Mag and Con. I went to see them. They
taught me a lot, those two girls; they
had fine flesh tints, better than the French
article as a rule.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have they been to see you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, Mag’s married, and her figure!—throw
your coat there—It’s a sin to see
it; women of that order should die young.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And Connie?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Connie! she’s grown frowsy, I’m
afraid it’s gin! There was a blackguard
she ‘walked with’ who levanted with a
cook, so it’s censorious to grudge her a
drop of comfort. But to think of those
pearly tints grown frowsy!” he murmured,
“to sell that colouring for a greasy mess
of pottage! The folly of man is inscrutable!—Strange,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>you want desert air, your skin
has lost tone!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Season, my good boy, what else can
you expect?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wonder if it’s all season,” thought
the fellow, and an unaccountable coldness
ran down his spine. “I wonder if he’s
made a mistake too!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How are you getting on, as to work?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have to speak of something else
first, and for reasons best known to
myself, I prefer fresh air for it—will you
stroll round?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I should like to see the picture first,”
said Strange.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of his old blushes mounted to
Brydon’s cheeks.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wait till afterwards, if you don’t
mind,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>“Look at the light from that gin-palace
on the red head of that child!” he went
on, as they turned the corner, “it’s funny
what glorious effects one gets from the
filthiest combinations! There is no light
more bewildering and lovely than the
phosphoric blue flicker from a grave-yard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That effect now, those reeking gin lights
on that beastly dirty head, and the corpse
lights are like a lot of writers’ work, no
one can pass it by, it has a power to
grasp and hold you, that cleaner things
don’t have, and such power means genius,
don’t you think? Power strong enough,
I mean, to stoop a fellow’s mind and
nose low enough to batten on corruption?
If the corruption wasn’t made worth
examining, one would only pass on, with
a kick at the seething mass. Instead of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>that, one looks and spits, and looks and
spits again, but keeps looking and finally
settles down to enjoy oneself and then a
fellow gets enervated and unmanned before
he knows what he is about. He sees
the pitiless truth of things, of course, but
he loses everything else—the result is
very limiting when one thinks of it.
Battening on certain books,” went on
Brydon after a pause, “was the beginning
of it, I think, then rottenness smells
sweet after a time, and a fellow gets
curious and wants to exploit on his own
account. I did all sorts of things first,
I tried trees, sun, shade, moonlight; I
walked blisters on my feet, I worked in
the sweat of my brow, but nothing would
still the brutal throbbing, and I went mad
one day in that maddening city. Art
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>wasn’t worth a straw to save me. I made
a beast of myself, the cheap sort of beast
that I had funds for, and—here is the
result!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, you’re a sorry object, it must
be confessed!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But that’s not the worst either—do
you know I have altogether lost the
way to work; I can do nothing. Now
some fellows can go down in the gutter
one day and mount up amongst the
gods the next without turning a hair; it
beats me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s a good deal a question of nationality,”
said Strange, “Englishmen as a rule
can’t do complete work while they’re
mud-larking; French fellows often can;
just as no decent bourgeois John Bull
has it in him to write tons of magnificent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>filth on a sort of principle. The fact is,
no fellow of your temperament has any
business to wallow in modern French
realism, you haven’t tone enough. I felt
certain this would happen, but you had to
take your chance with your betters, and
no doubt the experience hasn’t been all
loss. I am sorry for you all the same;
you’ll find your repentance a darned sight
bitterer than the delirium was sweet.
That is my experience anyway, and it
will go harder with you; your health, you
see, can’t stand it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It can’t, which makes me the bigger
fool. To think of my work being knocked
on the head, and to so little purpose!
Especially,” he added naïvely, “when one
has to do that sort of thing on the cheap.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fellows like you feel that sort of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>thing always, even if they have a pocket
full of coin. You see, you are too fastidious
and sensitive to enjoy vice properly;
and yet the queer thing is, it debases
you sooner than it does men of coarser
make, unless it kills you right off the
reel, as it mostly does. Stronger men
have things to keep them up, you fellows
haven’t; they get brutalized if you like,
but it is the brutalization of men, not of
women.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Here Brydon winced, possibly Strange
saw him—he took no notice, however, but
went on coolly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“They don’t get rotten-soft, and corrupt.
Another thing that’s against you;
your father’s a parson, and his father
before him, and your mother is a parson’s
daughter.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>“Yes—what on earth has that to do
with it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A lot. With inherited conscience and
spiritual feelings, and a sneaking regard
for hell fire in every drop of your blood,
things were sure to be made pretty hot
for you in next to no time. Small wonder
your work went to the devil!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I suppose it’s all the brutal truth,”
said Brydon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you expect this?” he asked
with sudden shyness. “Are you disappointed?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am too old ever to be disappointed
in any fellow, probably there’s not a thing
you have done I wouldn’t myself have
done had I been in your skin. Now the
question is, what’s to fit you for work
again?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“I think,” said the boy dolefully, “the
best thing I could do would be to cut
my throat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If I felt like an ass I should hold
my tongue about it, and take a blue pill.
By the way, there’s some contradiction,
for Blunt saw Legrun the other day, and
he’s tremendously pleased with you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I took to swatting for a time, as
a sop to Cerberus, and worked like the
very devil at drawing, but somehow I’d
rather get a kick any day, than praise,
when I know my work’s dishonest, done
to cover filth; it’s an insult to Art.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My good boy, don’t be morbid! It
was a good sight better to bring your
lines into order than to do nothing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All the same, I have no satisfaction
in any work done then.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“Ah, parson’s blood again—no need
you should, but you needn’t add it to the
list of your sins, that would be rather a
work of supererogation, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I would like to go out into the desert
alone for forty days or so, and wrestle
with anything that came along, God or
the devil.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A very proper attitude of mind and
befitting your breed. In the meantime,
when do you intend returning to Paris?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I must go to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why must you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Because——” he hesitated, blushing
furiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good Heavens, man, speak out! Have
we been friends for fifteen years for
nothing?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, beastliness, however cheap you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>do it, is costly. Even your magnificent
commission has gone down the gutter.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It wouldn’t pay either of us for
you to return there just now, besides, I
want you to come over and stay at my
house.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I cannot stay in the house with Lady
Strange,” said Brydon in a low voice,
“I couldn’t. If I am not clean enough
to work at my Art I am certainly not
fit to eat and drink in her presence. I
didn’t stay in my father’s house until my
mother and sisters had gone away, and—Lady
Strange, somehow, is divine to me.
She is always the bride in that picture.
I think,” he continued, with a strange
softness in his voice, “for all her jeering
at me, that I have painted the real
woman.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>It was Strange’s turn to wince this
time.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look here, Strange,” the boy went
on, still softly and with lowered head, “I
finished that picture before I went into
the sty. I wouldn’t have touched her
with a dirty brush.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear fellow, I know it! I should
have liked you to have stayed with
us. At any rate you will stay in London
for a few days; I will be your banker,
of course; it will be, after all, only a
very trifling increase of your debt to
me, and there’s plenty of time to pay
that in.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He took hold of the fellow’s arm and
swung him round.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s getting late,” he said, “and I want
to see the picture to-night.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>They walked on in silence, the boy’s
chivalrous adoration of his wife touched
Strange sharply. All the same, he felt
vastly inclined to turn round and punch
his head for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How dared the fellow go speculating
on her possibilities!” he thought; “that
is my business.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yet when one comes to think of it,
I’m an ass, I might just as well go for
the dozens of others whose admiration is
quite as vicarious. It’s not Gwen one
of the lot goes mad over, it’s her
double. Heigh ho! Bigamy’s an awful
embarrassment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I tried to keep exactly to Nature in
that last picture of Lady Strange,” said
Brydon, as he set to unfastening the
packing of his picture.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“You succeeded,” said Strange. Brydon
looked round.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You didn’t like it then—no more did
I, I tried too hard to be faithful to the
order.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, and so you were, and that was
what was wanted of you. Mrs. Waring,
for whom the portrait was intended, liked
it tremendously,” said Strange shortly.
“Damn the fellow’s impudence!” he
thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brydon continued his cutting and unwinding,
painfully red in the face.</p>

<p class='c000'>When it was all undone he waited for
a moment before he removed the last
covering, then he pulled it off with a
quick soft movement, and from a vague
feeling of half shy delicacy he turned aside
and began to cut up tobacco diligently.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>When Strange saw his wife, not the
cold living abstraction, but a warm, big-hearted,
divinely-natural creature, alive
there on the canvas before him, a sudden
soft gush of tears flooded his eyes, and
he shook and reeled at the queer warm
shock of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Brydon,” he said, turning round suddenly,
“one makes a fool of oneself over
her, it is a tribute to your genius.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Brydon looked at him and hesitated,
then he said in a half-fearful tone, looking
away,</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is no tribute to my genius, it is
that face! I never cried, I have roared
and howled, you know, scores of times,
but I never cried properly till I saw it;
it is the strongest and the most touching
woman’s face I ever saw.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“It is, and you have done infinite justice
to it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I had to paint her as she was there,
I couldn’t help myself, I shall never again
do anything like it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What does Legrun say of it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was silent for a minute.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you think,” he asked at last, angrily,
“that I did that for Legrun’s praise
or blame? Did I paint <em>her</em> to be
torn limb from limb by those old steely
eyes?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“As a matter of fact I did not expect
anything half so sensible from you, but
this—this,” he added slowly, with a spasm
of infinite generosity, “this shall hang in
the Academy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If it does,” said the boy, “I shall
never touch a brush again.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>“Well, we won’t discuss it now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nor at any other time. I shouldn’t
care a <a id='tup'></a>tuppenny damn, don’t you know, for
any fame for which you had to suffer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There was no word of suffering to
me, or to anyone else.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who said there was? But do you
see the alterations I made,” he went on
hurriedly, “I made you even vaguer than
you were and served the parson in the
same way, and that carpet in Waring church
was too strong altogether, I got a piece
of stem green stuff and substituted it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, it is a work of genius,” said
Strange as he got into his coat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am not such a fool as to deny that,
but <em>I</em> didn’t paint it, you know. Here,
you’ll break your neck on these stairs, let
me light you. Good night, dear old man.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>When</span> Mrs. Waring got the sketches of
her children—for Strange had used almost
physical force to compel Dacre to run
over to Paris to sit to Brydon—the very
first minute she found herself alone with
them she cried her heart out over the
two, then she sat herself down and
systematically adored them.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had them hung in the library
where she could see them from her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>writing-table and only for their weight
she would have had them carried to her
room every night.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Waring, in his emotionless way,
valued his daughter’s gift, but this chronic
passion of adoration was beyond him. He
had already borne much with divine
patience; he had seen his wife carried away
from his side for hours at a stretch, to
waste her mind and soul in the duties of
an ordinary squire’s wife, and she had
come back to babble of babies in a way
that made his blood run cold. He had
caught her thoughts wandering at moments
when the crisis of a discovery was setting
in, and with tears in her eyes that the
subject under discussion could in no wise
account for. Ah, he had suffered in a
thousand indefinable ways!</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>But yet there were moments when he
had her still, just as in the sweet old
times, body and soul and brain, all to
himself; when she still put out all the
force of her keen fine intellect and saw,
with her beautiful intuition, puzzles that
had made his great man’s brain reel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Through all time had ever any man
such a wife, he would think, as he watched
her softly frowning, pondering over a
thought and bringing out the result with
that charming diffidence, that wonderful
veneration for the nice intricacies of
truth that characterized her, looking withal
so young, so soft, so serene.</p>

<p class='c000'>No wonder that the man’s heart clave
unto her!</p>

<p class='c000'>And now those pictures! That sublimely
haughty young woman—that big
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>strong soldier with pluck of a most soulless
British order stamped all over him,
came in and robbed him of the better part
of himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>They still sat side by side, hand in
hand, and worked together, but they were
no longer one. No wonder indeed, that
untimely age fell upon the man and
forced him with its chill hand down on
his stick, a little heavier as each day
passed!</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Waring did not go out every day,
her restless yearning often took her no
farther than the children’s old nursery,
where she would sit by their little chests
of drawers and finger their old yellowing
baby clothes with a shy sad wistful
wonderment; she had never put a stitch
into one of them, and their shapes and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>intricacies were sealed mysteries to her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mary, now grown aged and gray, looked
upon the state of affairs with much
dissatisfaction, and seemed likely to continue
to do so, for things instead of getting
better got worse. Mr. and Mrs. Fellowes
did all they could to turn her gentle
persistent grief into a more healthy channel
and were by no means careful to spare
her any plain speaking, but it seemed
impossible to get her to fit her new sweet
sad experience into her old life and to
make a whole of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a frightful grind to get a great
heartful of fresh emotions, of new sorrows
and joys, into a middle-aged woman, and
not to cause a general disruption. It
seemed rather hard, however, that Mr.
Waring should half perish in his wife’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>own particular earthquake. But though
his grief lay down with him at night
and rose with him day by day, he cherished
her with ever-increasing tenderness,
and never by word or look expressed
the smallest atom of reproach.</p>

<p class='c000'>Towards the end of July a little fleecy
cloud of hope, no bigger than a man’s
hand, appeared upon the horizon, and Mr.
Waring grasped it with nervous despair.</p>

<p class='c000'>After repeated puttings off, Gwen was
coming for certain in a week or two,
to remain until the shooting took them
North.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps now,” the poor man thought,
“perhaps now she will find what she wants,
and can rest and be satisfied, and our life
will return to us. This maternal feeling
must certainly be a very powerful and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>very precious factor in a woman’s making,
or such an one as my wife would not be
so touched and shaken by its advent and
growth in her. It is a mystery, in truth,
thus to come so late, born out of due
season as it were, and so strongly to take
possession of her. I certainly never
should have classed her among the true
mothers, the producing women; they should
be of a more robust, a more animal
type altogether. It is a most remarkable
case, with curious complications. It is the
daughter—the feminine part of her—my
wife yearns and pants for, the masculine
element seems to affect her but little;
when our son Dacre visits us I have in
vain looked for any symptoms of satisfaction
or restfulness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I feel so unusually depressed and aged,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>this afternoon,” he went on, slowly,
laying down his fruitless pen, and gazing
with sad eyes out of the window, “even
my ordinary lucidity of brain seems
clouding and thickening. It cannot be
that I have already reached the ultimatum,
and that the period of decadence is now
upon me—that cannot surely be! Only
just forty-seven,” he cried softly, and his
face sank down in his hands on the
study table.</p>

<p class='c000'>He raised it again, and went over
to his cabinet and touched his heaps
of manuscript one by one with loving
lingering tenderness, but a little shakily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This but just begun!” he murmured;
“this but just wanting the verification of
an experiment or two; these, notes for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>a new work, the most comprehensive,
the most exact we have yet made—ah!
this book would have been very close
up to the truth, nearer to it than
anything yet produced.—She looked with
such keen, such very youthful pleasure
to the lighter task of compilation; that
youthfulness in her intellectual pleasures
is a very precious gift of my wife.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here is a little satirical skit she
wrote in a playful moment, how charming
it is, how delicate! Ah, my sweet
young wife! More notes—more—and
so few worked out to their final
conclusion! Must I then take these
symptoms as those of untimely decay,”
he whispered sitting down again, “I, who
looked to long years of honest labour in
which I might have forged on farther
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>than my fellows, and have erected some
fresh finger-posts on the road to everlasting
truth? To stop now, when the
world is crying and wailing in the
darkness of its ignorance, when men grasp
any scrap of verified knowledge as a
drowning man a straw, and must I be
swept down the hill before I have breasted
the crest? Must I sink to oblivion with
my work but just begun, and with the
heat of battle strong upon me—and she—my
wife, my own, my helpmeet——Do none
of these things strike and touch her, does
this overmastering strange tumult of new
emotions shut her heart to the awful
beauty of truth?</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is strange,” he repeated, “strange,
and very sad. The swift-running smooth
course of life has been paralyzed for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>me, I am oppressed with torturing
doubts, and—and—I believe it is not age,
it is not the years which have stunned
my powers, I believe it is this new phase
of her life; then comes the consideration:
is this a passing phase, or is it permanent?
I cannot face the question!” he cried
with a groan, holding his head in both
hands to steady it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he took his hat and stick, and
made mechanically for the Rectory.</p>

<p class='c000'>She always came from that direction,
and always sadder than when she went
forth.</p>

<p class='c000'>But to-day she was different. When
she saw her husband she did not keep
to her ordinary soft listless movements,
and then when she reached him, slip her
hand into his mechanically from mere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>reflex action, and strike out eagerly into
an infant anecdote.</p>

<p class='c000'>She started and flushed, and ran towards
him with outstretched hands, and looked
wistfully up in his face, and her mouth
trembled as, for the first time, the great
change in the man flashed itself into her, and
her heart stood still and her brain reeled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Henry!” she cried, “My Henry, you
are tired!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He stooped wonderingly closer to her.
“Dearest, no!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She gazed with sickening dread up into
his face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, yes, you are tired and sad. Mr.
Fellowes has been telling me so much,
making things clear, and—and—yes, you
are older, and I never saw it until this
instant.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“My love, I am well!” he said, caressing
her softly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is I who have done this, Henry”—she
silenced his protest with a soft imperious
motion—“they saw it weeks ago; I am
a bad wife now, as I have been a bad
mother—ah, that is very sad!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She laid her head down on their clasped
hands and with a little shudder broke
into soft sobbing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are a most true, most noble
wife,” he whispered, “my helpmeet in
all things!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have gone away and neglected you,
and you have grown older.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come home, my best beloved, come
home and rest.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If I only could,” she said wistfully, “but
dear, I am restless, I cannot stay still.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>“After Gwen went away,” she continued
softly, with bent head, as they
paced slowly up the drive, “my heart
seemed to fill with restless growth, new
thoughts and feelings were for ever astir
in me, I could not rest; old feelings that
should have had their budding and birth
long ago only then awoke, and beset me
with sweet pain.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She stopped and leaned up against
him. “I have never been able to tell
you all this before, except indirectly.
Ah, Henry, such strange new thoughts
torture and soothe me, they war with one
another continually and there is not one
drop of sweetness that has not two drops
of bitterness to temper it withal.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let’s walk on, dearest, you are cold.—I
have such strange yearnings, Henry, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>baby touches and baby kisses, I, who
have never felt them for my own, have
to seek them among babies not of my
flesh and blood. I have to find the
pale ghosts of them amongst my lost
children’s little clothes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My love, not lost.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, Henry, lost, more than if the
grave had closed over them; those forfeited
things do not return. I have a mother’s
heart now when I no longer need it,”
she said, with a wan smile, “and I know—ah,
I know so many things, such
pitiful things. The other day a tiny baby
grasped at my breast and tried to nestle
his head there—to suck my breast, Henry—it
was worse than death, for I knew I
had lost the best sweetness of life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My love, my love, those things are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>lost,” cried her husband, and then with
sudden and surprising astuteness, he added,
“there will be Gwen’s children.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She clutched his hand in a sudden tremor
of excitement.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, and then—<em>then</em>, too, Gwen might
understand—now—” she coughed softly
and broke off.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But, Henry, I have you, we will go
together as we used to do; perhaps work,
regular work, may make me feel better.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My love,” he cried eagerly, “I am
certain it is just the thing you want, the
very thing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps,” she said sadly, “perhaps
it is.”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>One</span> morning Strange came into his
wife’s boudoir with his whip in his hand,
and a light overcoat on his arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am going out beyond Highgate,” he
said, “to see a pointer pup, it is a pretty
drive, would you like to come?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She had been thinking with a sort of
dread of the hours that must run before
the darkness came, and of the numbers of
times she would be expected to smile, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>return brilliant answers to dull questions,
and generally to keep up her superb
deception.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had a dozen engagements but she
decided to go with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He drove a high mail-phaeton that ran
very lightly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That Highgate hill is a bad one,” he
said as they were starting, giving the
brake a sharp tug, “I don’t think this
will cave in easily, however.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Besides, Hengist and Horsa can be
trusted anywhere,” said Gwen, who knew
nothing of ordinary nervousness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wouldn’t trust anything in horseflesh
down a steep hill with the brake off.
Look down that mesh of streets! Taking
it in patches there isn’t a more hideous,
sordid, mean hole in the world than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>this London, just look through that lane!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen gave a shrug of disgust.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s all frightful and gray and deadly
dull, but that never strikes me as the
worst part of life in these places. It is
the hideous want of privacy that revolts
me, and the awful nearness of one human
creature to another, the sheer impossibility
of thinking, or feeling, or looking, except
under observation, the horrible indecent
openness of life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you know about it?” he
asked laughing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I have done slumming in my time,
under Mrs. Meades’ wing. I like new
experiences, you know. We saw a great
many frightful things while the craze
lasted, but the worst of all was a cobbler’s
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ménage</span></i>. He had a wife and seven children,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>and they lived in two rooms, he never went
out, that man, neither did his wife; she
squatted on the floor all day and cleaned
things with a patent soap which smelt
worse than they did, and he saw all she
did and thought and felt; the awful hunted
look of that <a id='wom'></a>woman was a thing to
dream of.</p>

<p class='c000'>“While Mrs. Meades talked—‘religion’
she called it—the cobbler sewed leather,
and glanced now and again at his wife
in a way to make your blood freeze, and
then he would hold up his awl in a ghastly
fashion, and grin at her over it; it was no
bit of steel he was gloating over, it was
his wife’s soul held up on that awl.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But putting husbands and wives
out of the question,” she went on,
“this appalling nearness of living is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>most horrible. One must feel for ever
on a dissecting table, having one’s most
hidden nerves pulled out one by one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They have no nerves, and they don’t
experiment on one another, those people;
they don’t live enough for that, they exist in
a smoky thick atmosphere of indifference.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That man did experiment, and his wife
was not indifferent; she was nerves and
nothing else.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“These were exceptions.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The worst tragedies are made out of
exceptions.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Probably, exceptions are mostly unnatural.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is not unnatural to object to have
one’s sensations flayed alive!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Such sensitiveness is unnatural to a
low under-fed semi-sentient state of life,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>such people have enough to do to keep
body and soul together, without considering
them apart.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I contend they do consider them
apart, they do make investigations.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, into the vices of their betters,
which have a perennial interest for them
as being beyond their reach. You won’t
catch them as a rule classifying one another
and flaying souls. These are the distractions
of the leisure classes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then,” said Gwen, “I wish I had been
born in the other class.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To what purpose?” said her husband,
“you would have been an exception.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, then,” she said impatiently, “I
shall in future reserve all my pity for
the exceptions, and retain my normal
hardness of heart for the other crowd.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>I never could get universal philanthropy to
appeal to me, and it’s comfortable to put
one’s want of humanity on a reasonable
basis. But those generations of square pegs
in round holes, they worry one! And yet
people speak of a just God!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Poor God! What should we do without
that universal scape-grace? As if He had
anything to do with the matter! The
fathers have trusted to chance, and the
children suffer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But at any rate whether the fathers
or God are the real scape-goats it’s quite
original nowadays to profess faith in
justice, and to refrain from railing against
the Almighty, so we’ll let God and heredity
have a rest; besides, we are losing the
pauper scent and getting that of the
country—did you catch that whiff? I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>glad we are down this hill, the horses
are unaccountable.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hengist actually looks like kicking,”
said Gwen.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bell, get off, will you, I believe there’s
a fly somewhere I can’t spot.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sure enough, three on ’em, sir; and
them horses is mortal thin-skinned since
their clipping yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What a duffer I was,” said Strange
to his wife, “not to look at them before
we started, they are probably not half
groomed and are tickling like the
deuce, and I can’t even have the
satisfaction of swearing about it properly,
as I was every bit as careless
myself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A quick little conviction shot into Gwen,
that whatever God and the general ruck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>of fathers might be, her husband was just
enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>This silenced her for two solid miles.
When they got near the Inn, Strange
suggested that they had better stay and
lunch there.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes, it really doesn’t matter,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wonder what does, in her present
mood!” thought Strange, as he helped her
down.</p>

<p class='c000'>As ill-luck would have it, a wretched
faint feeling she had experienced once or
twice before, came on her, and she reeled
a little in her husband’s hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked at her in the most utter
astonishment, he hadn’t fathomed her yet
it seemed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you ill?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>She blushed suddenly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, my foot got twisted in my shoe-lace.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The girl is lying,” he thought, with a
most unpleasant shock.</p>

<p class='c000'>He brought her into a small, clean,
quaint old room, fragrant with mignonette,
a bunch stood in a glass on the cottage
piano and there was a long green box
full of it on the window-sill.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now sit in here in the shade,” he
said, “and take off your hat, and rest.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He stood for a moment and watched
her, then he arranged the pillows on the
couch and made her lie down, with an
involuntary protecting manner quite unlike
his usual airs of equality and sexlessness.</p>

<p class='c000'>That lie had made her all at once so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>young to him, so infinitely pathetic.</p>

<p class='c000'>He could have taken her in his arms
like a little child, and hushed her to sleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he had gone she clenched her
hands in a rage.</p>

<p class='c000'>“One can’t call one’s soul one’s own
with such a man!” she muttered, “it’s
bondage worse than death. Talk of that
cobbler, he’s not the only man who holds
his wife’s soul on an awl—oh, the horrible,
horrible, horrible indecency of marriage
without love! And this vile pretence of
fair living!” she went on, sitting up and
staring out of the window, “the jokes
we have together, and the talks!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She got up and went about the room
examining the curiosities, the stuffed birds,
and the shells, and the awful oleographs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What’s this?” she said, lifting the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>glass from some glittering object, but she
dropped it as if it stung her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, why did I touch it? I am sick
to death of everything.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She went over to the sofa and flung
herself back among the cushions.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a great slab of frosted wedding-cake,
kept over for the first christening.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, it’s all a most frantic joke!” she
said. “Here he comes, I must sit up and
play to my audience, knowing all the
time the audience sees into the marrow
of my bones.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She was not perhaps quite sane, as
saneness goes, all through their lunch, but
she was strangely brilliant, her eyes flashed
with a queer fluttering light, her lips were
soft and mobile, and she ate her chicken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>with a will, and only that her natural
fineness of nature restrained her, she would
have seized the big old cut-glass decanter
of wine and have drained it at a gulp.
But she kept the curb well on and never
once flagged in her course, which surprised
herself even more than it did her husband.</p>

<p class='c000'>But when he went out to see the horses
put in she had a little private collapse
all to herself.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was hotter than ever and the flies
grew more troublesome, but it was all
very fresh and green.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I never knew this part was so pretty,”
she said as they were driving through a
chestnut-bordered lane. Talking was an
effort but it seemed a less exhaustive one
than sitting there mute under her husband’s
reflections.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“It’s pretty,” he said absently, “and
almost as little known as Central Africa;
look at the indifferent calm estate of those
cows, they might live in the desert for
anything they know of the noise of life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, and here we are in the thick of
genteel barbarism,” said Gwen, as they
turned into the high road. “It is well for the
cows that they live by sight, not by imagination;
it’s a horrid anomaly, the cows and
the country, and not a hundred yards away
’Arry rampant.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe I like the combinations, still
life, and life in the struggle, and ’Arry
everywhere, from cradle to grave, his
cemetery not a stone-throw away.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your toleration is rather overpowering,”
remarked Gwen sardonically, “you speak
in the same kindly good-humoured way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>of ’Arry and of God, adopting the same
heavy-fatherly style to both.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I really beg their pardons, but as a
matter of fact, I look on them both as
much-maligned beings and as requiring
the conscientious championship of all
honest citizens. We judge the two, the
Potter and His clay, by measuring them
by our own standards. I think, for
my own part, it’s amazing impudence
to sit at one’s ease and damn ’Arry,
as is the vogue now; nearly as much
the vogue as sitting at ease and
criticizing the Almighty. I must, however,
leave God and man, and proceed
to think chiefly of horses for the
present. Look at those brutes of donkey
carts!”</p>

<p class='c000'>They were just going up the hill which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>was abnormally crowded. The donkey carts
were ubiquitous.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I never saw them so thick before,”
said Strange, “why, I forgot, of course,
it’s a holiday! I wonder if it will be so
crowded down the hill? Those tram lines
are the deuce for hoofs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They drove on silently between the
rows of quaint old houses, till they got
to the crest of the hill coming down
towards Holloway.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The horses seem steady enough now,”
said Gwen.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, they’re all right—just as well too.
Did you ever see such a crowd!—Phew!”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a rustle and a flying glimmer
of white from a costermonger’s cart
coming slowly up the hill behind a
jaded ass.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>It was the <em>Echo</em> of the day before, caught
by a sudden flickering breeze, and carried
fantastically to and fro right under the
horses’ noses; they threw up their heads
and sniffed angrily, but Strange had them
well in hand and soothed their terror
gently, and being no fools the brutes
were just realizing the causelessness of
their fright, when a demon got into the
breeze, caught the paper in its clutches,
and with a rushing swirl of leaves, dashed
it into Hengist’s two eyes right between
the blinkers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Blinded, tickled, irritated to madness,
the horse lashed out wildly, plunged
forward, carrying Horsa with him, and
tore down the hill.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were beyond restraint now, it
was only possible to swing them by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>sheer strength out of destruction’s way.
It was a touch-and-go game from the first.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just as they got very nearly down the
hill, there was a sudden jarring click.
Gwen saw her husband’s leg drop sharply.
He turned one look on her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Brake’s gone!” he shouted, sawing
the mouths of the frantic horses till the
veins stood out like cords on his wrists.</p>

<p class='c000'>He would have felt the whole thing
less hideous and awful if even then he
could have seen one sign of failing courage
in his wife, if she had once clutched him,
once cried out, once showed an atom of
weak womanhood. But in all the mad
tumultuous race with death her calm,
inscrutable, half-scornful face loomed on
him, watching each movement of his, and
not one shade paler.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>She was more beautiful and less of
a woman than she had ever been in all
her life.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were just at the twist of the hill,
the traffic was denser than ever, the
carriage swayed wildly, and the shrill
screaming of women was giving the last
touch to the horses’ madness. The final
crash was upon them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“One last experiment,” thought Strange,
laughing aloud in a grim spasm of humour.
“Gwen!” he shouted, “will you kiss me
once, as women kiss men?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She might have done it without that
clause, she changed colour for the first
time, her mouth twitched, she loosed her
hands from their half-mechanical grasp on
the seat, and looked in her husband’s face
laughing above her.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>No tears ever held the pathos of that
laugh.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why can’t I kiss him and be done
with it?” she thought wildly. “Truth or
lie, what matters it now!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She moved forward slightly with curved
lips, then she looked again, one little look,
but it was enough, her hands fell limp
into her lap, and she shivered from head
to foot.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No!” she shouted, her eyes aflame,
“if that had been possible I shouldn’t
have left it until now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then she pulled herself together to
show a decent front to death.</p>

<p class='c000'>The silent laugh on Strange’s face
broke into sound, above all the bedlam
of clang and yell, then it ceased suddenly.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Great gouts of blood and foam flew to
right and left from the lips and nostrils
of the horses, who were blind now in their
anguish.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hold tight, Gwen!” roared her husband
hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c000'>The horses swayed and shuddered, screaming
with terror.</p>

<p class='c000'>With one despairing shriek, Bell covered
his face.</p>

<p class='c000'>The swerving wheel caught in the tram-line
and then came the end.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>As</span> always happens in such cases it was
several minutes after the crash before
anyone with an ounce of reason in his
head appeared on the scene.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a fellow—he was in the dog
line, “and knew a thing or two”—dropped
in and took a rapid and comprehensive
view of affairs, and by the help of
infinite blasphemy did what was best
under the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Strange was only stunned. After a time
he sat up, and looked about him.</p>

<p class='c000'>A howl from Bell struck on his ears. He
turned and saw the horses shivering among
the broken mass of carriage, and the dog-man
rubbing their noses to a soft gurgling
accompaniment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where, where?” he asked faintly,
and in reply to a pointed finger, lifted
himself up with both hands, and groped
half-blindly to a huddled-up lump of muslin
and lace.</p>

<p class='c000'>He just knew she was lying there,
cold, and white, and moveless. He touched
her forehead; it was like marble. He
laid his hand on her heart; it was
still.</p>

<p class='c000'>A sudden wonder seized him as to who
had undressed and covered her with such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>lovely decency, and he looked with half
vague inquiry at the two women hovering
near.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a matter of fact it was the
dog-man who had done it, with his eyes
turned on the two women whom he cursed
foully the whole time.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you sent for a doctor?” demanded
Strange, forcing the dizziness out of his
brain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, yes,” was yelled from twenty
throats, “and here he is.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was a sufficiently foolish young man,
and seemed floored.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Live far from here?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In Ebury Square,” said Strange, “is
there any danger in taking her so far?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“None, if conveyed on boards in a
four-wheeler.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Strange saw at once that the dog-man
was the only one who had his senses
about him; Bell, though absolutely unhurt,
was altogether useless, and the other man
had been left at the inn.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You know the horses and cabs here
about?” said Strange. “Get the smoothest
cab and some boards, and here, you’ll
want help, don’t spare tips.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The man went, and was back before
the doctor had made up his mind what
to say to cover his ignorance.</p>

<p class='c000'>A fat woman, who had lent the
mattress to cover the boards, and who
had been hovering over his wife for some
time, here called Strange aside.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You had better have your own doctor
at once,” she said, “that there young
man is soft. She wants skill, and, sir,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>she added, with a soft twiddle of her thumb,
“I have my suspicions.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange looked enquiringly at her, and
a cold shiver ran down to his toes.</p>

<p class='c000'>For hours after she was brought home
Gwen lay insensible. The doctor did
nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Her physique alone will help her,”
he said, when Strange seemed to demand
action of some sort.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She will regain her consciousness all
right,” he said. “There is another complication,
I believe,” he added, looking keenly
at Strange, “but the treatment of that
must come later.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Again the horrid coldness paralyzed
Humphrey’s very marrow.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In view of this,” the doctor went on,
“what about her mother being summoned?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Strange thought for a moment. Her
mother was, of course, quite out of the
question, and he remembered that Mrs. Fellowes
was ill.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is this necessary at once?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, I will tell you when the need
arises—that is, if any should. Her physique
would tide over almost anything.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As the clock began to strike midnight,
Strange saw the doctor stoop suddenly,
and lay his head on Gwen’s heart, then
open her eyes and touch her eyeballs.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he raised himself his face had
altered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now we shall soon see a change,”
he said, “perhaps you had better stand
back, even the shock of joy might hurt her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange gave a ghastly grin in the
shadow of the curtain.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>By a superhuman effort in all those
hours of anguished waiting, even when
the doctor and the nurse, in their
consideration, had left him alone for
the purpose, Strange had never once
kissed or caressed his wife, or even so
much as touched her except in matters
of service.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen stirred almost imperceptibly, the
doctor looked round the curtain at Strange.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Touch her, and speak to her very
gently,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>He bent gently over her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen, wake up, dear, wake up,
sweetheart!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He wondered the next second “why the
devil” he said it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps the absurdity of the words
struck Gwen’s grim sense of humour, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>certainly stirred uneasily and made a
feeble pathetic little try to throw up the
limp hand that lay on the quilt.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange moved back under cover of
his curtain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good!” said the doctor, “try again.”
He was watching Strange’s face with some
interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He has aged ten years in eight
hours, poor devil!” he thought, then he
took a long survey of his patient, “I
wonder if she is worth it all, she is a
trifle too superb for me! She looks like
one of those women who keep their flesh
too much under.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gradually Gwen’s stirrings grew stronger
and more frequent, and at last she opened
her eyes slowly and looked out with vague
questioning.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“What is it?” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have been ill, dear.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ill?” she murmured perplexedly. “I
want light.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The doctor moved the screens from before
the candles, Gwen raised her head feebly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is it?” she asked again.</p>

<p class='c000'>The doctor lifted her and gave her a
draught he had ready, she was too weak
to resist him, and presently she fell off
into a drowsy half-slumber.</p>

<p class='c000'>After what seemed to Strange a lifetime,
she again moved, woke, and repeated
the old question, this time audibly and
with a tinge of imperiousness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, she’ll do now,” said the doctor
to himself, grinning a saturnine grin, “when
a woman shows her pet weakness she’s
out of danger.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>He put back the screen. “I am
thankful to say,” he said to her, “you
are the sole sufferer, and you’ll soon be
all right again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Humphrey was well then. She shut her
dazed eyes and tried to think, but she could
only hover off into drowsiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a time she opened her eyes again
and said,</p>

<p class='c000'>“I would like my maid, perhaps you
would tell Sir Humphrey that I am better.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your husband hardly requires the
information,” said the doctor drily. “I
shall leave Lady Strange in your hands,
Sir Humphrey, and I shall remain on the
premises in case you want me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>His wife turned her eyes away and
began searching for her handkerchief, he
stooped and gave it to her.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>The sweat still clung to his ghastly
forehead and hung on his hair.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He said you were not hurt,” she said,
“you look as if you were.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s been rather a disturbing day,” he
said, with sudden bitterness. “Never mind
me, I’ll be as jolly as a sandboy after a
bath.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She turned herself uneasily on the pillow
and shut her eyes. It was horrible to
have him there above her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Poor little child, poor little unfinished
thing!” he thought pitifully. “Shall I
send your maid, dear?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, please, and won’t—oh, won’t you
rest?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I’m off,” he said, in his old cheery
voice, and he went outside the door and
watched there till morning.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>She was very white the next morning,
and kept falling off into drowsy little
sleeps, but she declared she was all right
and meant to get up; the necessity of staying
in bed was a new one and she
loathed it.</p>

<p class='c000'>She felt more in her husband’s power,
lying there ill; she grew suspicious
too, for the first time in her life, and set
herself to search for meanings in looks.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am demoralized,” she kept repeating.
Then she turned her face from the light,
and neither spoke nor looked except when
she absolutely had to.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange could make nothing at all of
her, and he soon left her for sheer mercy’s
sake.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he had gone she raised herself
up and rang the bell.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“Give me what I am to take and then
leave me for two hours, I will sleep if I
can.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The girl brought her a bowl of beef-tea,
and she plunged heroically into it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am doing my duty,” she said to herself,
with a sneer, “but oh, will this
liquid never get less? on the contrary, it
seems to increase. You won’t let me be
disturbed, will you, Gill?” she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the girl had gone she got
up and locked the door, then she rolled up
her hair, put on a dressing-gown, and sat
down on the floor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have two hours in which to have it out
with myself—this horror made manifest,”
she said. “How was it that this most
natural of all complications never entered
my head? I wasn’t even warned by those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>new and altogether abominable feelings of
weakness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She leaned her head against the ottoman
and shivered, then she reached over for
a shawl that lay on it, and wrapped
herself up in it, but still she shivered.</p>

<p class='c000'>She stood up and was about to go
back to her bed, but she turned sharply
round with another shudder, “Bah! I
can’t,” she said and throwing a fur rug
on to a couch she lay down there and
soon grew warm enough to continue her
dreary meditations.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And so I, I, Gwen Strange, will
soon be the mother of a child—and
Humphrey its father!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She hid her face in the soft fur.
“It is ghastly!” she cried, “it is
degradation, feeling towards him as I do,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>and as I’ve always done! I am debased
to think that any man should have the
least part of a woman so terribly in his
power, when she can’t, can’t, can’t,” she
almost shrieked, “give him the best.
What do girls know of the things they
make lawful for themselves? If they
did, if they were shown the nature of
their sacrifice, then marriage would
cease till it carried love, absolute love in
its train. Was I mad, my God! was I
mad, with all my boasts of sanity?—Nothing,
nothing,” she moaned, “but perfect
love makes marriage sacred, nothing, neither
God’s law nor man’s, and now the climax
has come here in the outward and visible
sign of my shame—I have sinned, not
only in the present and the past but in
the future, I have hurt an innocent unborn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>creature, I have set a barrier between it
and its mother.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And Humphrey! Now I must sit
under those deep all-pervading eyes of
his and feel myself ten thousand times
his chattel. Now we have a common
hope, a common interest, almost a common
existence, now every touch of his, every
look of his, will burn me and remind me
of my shame. Talk of the shame of
women who have children out of the pale
of marriage, it’s nothing to the shame of
those who have children and don’t love.
Those others, they have the excuse of love,
that’s natural, that purifies their shame;
this, our life—the portion of quite half
the well-to-do world—this is unnatural, no
sin can beat it for cruel baseness!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She huddled into her rug and lay silent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>wild mad thoughts whirling through her
brain. Gradually she grew calmer and more
reasonable.</p>

<p class='c000'>“At least I can do one thing,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will do all I can to make up to my
child for the harm I have done it ignorantly,
I will take care of myself, I will do everything
I can to bring a natural creature
into the world, I will try to protect it
from its heredity. I am glad I know, I
will do all I can to right your wrong,
poor child!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She waved her hands to and fro in
a sort of dumb agony.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And I could not even kiss your father,
I couldn’t even kiss him when we both
thought we were facing death!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She suddenly laughed aloud, a low
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>curious mocking laugh, and put her hands
up to her head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I must rest!” she cried, “I must
not think any more. I will have some
more of that draught, it makes thinking
a pulpy sweet sort of muddle, it takes
all the keen edges off truth. If I did
right,” she went on throwing her arms
back, “I would go out on a crusade to
girls and tell them all the truth, then,
let them sin in knowledge not in ignorance,
let them know that love, perfect
love, is the only sanctification of marriage!
Churches and rings are a mere
farce.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She had come to the last shred of her
strength; she crept into bed, and rang for
her draught.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>A few</span> days after, she was quite well
enough to get up, the doctor told her to
do so in the morning, but after looking
out into the day she lay down again. She
was not quite ready for life yet; here, in
her bed, she was more or less aloof from
it, but after a few hours restless thinking,
getting up, and lunch, came to be a distinct
relief.</p>

<p class='c000'>Directly after lunch she went out for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>a drive, and when she returned, and had
got into her tea-gown, she went down to
her boudoir and threw herself on the
sofa with a weary little laugh.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why can’t I rest or sew? why
won’t my body get as tired as my
brain? I could move a hundredweight
this minute.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She got up and moved, with hardly any
exertion, a great cabinet that would have
tried the strength of a fair-sized man.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Humphrey declared I couldn’t,” she
said, laughing again. “Gru! I can’t sit
here and think. I wonder where is Humphrey—I
believe I should like to ride a race,
or to spend an hour on a switchback
railway!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She went down and wandered from room
to room with her long strong movements,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>every one of them the very incarnation
of healthy grace.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last she found herself at the door
of Strange’s den. With a sudden wilful
impulse she opened the door and went in.
Every window was open, and the soft
cool air was playing high jinks among
the curtains.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange had brought his collection of
odds and ends from his chambers, and
had scattered them through the big
alcoved room in a sort of orderly disorder.
The floor was stained and spread with
an amazing collection of skins. In his
divings into studios he had learnt the
comfort and use of screens; there were
several in the room, kept well out of
the way of knees and shoulders.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thanks to the draught the cigar smoke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>had lost its heaviness, and was floating
as a sort of spiritual essence through the
textures.</p>

<p class='c000'>For some minutes after Gwen came
in she could hardly discern it at all,
when she did she wished she could
transport it to her part of the house,
it struck her as being a purer scent than
one gets in women’s rooms.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How hospitable those chairs look!”
she said, feeling one. “Does he lose all
his right hand gloves, I wonder! Do
all men? As a matter of fact I know
amazingly little of men or of their ways!
This is a clean, self-respecting room, I like
it, I wonder I never took any notice
of it before! Ah, another screen!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She moved it aside and found an alcove
where an easel stood, and on this a picture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>hidden by a drapery of primrose and
chestnut silk.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The way that drapery falls is quite
different from anything else,” said Gwen
stepping back a pace or two, “why
won’t my tea-gowns go like that!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Something suggested to her just then
to pry no further, but she swept the
suggestion aside with the draperies, and
saw before her her own painted image.
For one minute she felt inclined to rip
the canvas from end to end, and to kill
once and for all the vague look of motherhood
in the woman’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This wretch!” she muttered at last,
“so she’s in the house! As if I hadn’t
enough to handicap me without her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She turned away with a look of loathing
and jealous hatred, and sat down.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>After a little she got up slowly and
turned to leave the room, then almost in
spite of herself she went back to the
picture and began again her angry eager
inspection of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she stood with her head thrown
back and her hands clenched involuntarily,
her husband came in. He did not see
her for a minute; when he did, he
stopped, and watched her.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a revelation and a shock to see
her in this abandonment of jealous anger.
He rustled a book on the table to arouse
her and quoted, laughing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Where the apple reddens, never pry!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Lest we lose our Eden—Eve and I.”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>She moved quickly aside into the
shade.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“When did this come?” she asked, in
a low constrained voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Brydon sent it a few days ago. You
are better?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am quite well, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The doctor thinks directly you can
travel we had better go into the country.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She flung a swift furtive look at him.
“How much does he know, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Won’t you sit down?” he asked, putting
a soft low chair within her reach, “and
may I smoke?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She bent her head without speaking,
and he saw that her hands were moving
restlessly.</p>

<p class='c000'>He lit his cigar in a leisurely fashion,
then he drew up a chair and sat down
near her and began to smoke.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a time he set to wonder how long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>this remarkable vigil was going to hold out.
He was determined to keep silence till his
wife spoke; he saw she was fighting in
her dumb concentrated way for expression;
he felt certain some sort of an avalanche
was about to descend upon him, and he
preferred she should set it sliding herself.
Perhaps the girl had had too much lonely
struggle and her brain as well as her
body had weakened with it, at any rate
the first thought she felt herself producing
audibly was,</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish almost you were a fool, Humphrey!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He took his cigar out of his mouth.
“Indeed, why?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Because then,” she said, rather desperately,
“I shouldn’t feel so altogether like
one myself!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>She stood suddenly up and looked down
at him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look here,” she said, “you are better
in every point than I am, you are
better in brain, you are stronger, you
have seen more, you know more, you
are better all round. If you were a fool
you see, I could despise you; if even you
had once made yourself ridiculous in my
eyes or had demeaned yourself, what I
have to say would come easy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come to the point at once, Gwen,”
he said. “What is it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She took no notice of his remark but went
to the picture and drew the coverings over
the face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What has the doctor told you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The doctor has told me nothing definite.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>She turned away to hide her hot
face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You know perfectly well,” she said in
a low voice, “that I shall be the mother
of a child of yours in some months.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” he said gently.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But you do not know,” she went on,
“you do not know that this is such a
shame to me, such a deathly burning shame,
that I hate the light, I hate the eyes of
any human creature on me, I would like
to fly in the night to some desert place,
and hide myself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you mad, Gwen?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, I am sane, as sane as on the
day I sold myself to you for an experiment.
Can you not see, Humphrey, that I am
as shameful, I, your wife, as any one of
those women you told me of, not one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>whom you loved—loved?” she added, with
an involuntary raising of her head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am no nearer to you now,” she went
on, “than I was that day, not a jot nearer,
and yet I am going to be the mother of
your child! Are you dense, Humphrey,
or is it because you are a man and are
grown used to chattels, that you cannot
see the depth of my shame and humiliation,
and the reasons for it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She faltered and swayed slightly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sit down, Gwen, sit down at once.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He drew up the chair to her. “The
situation seems a curious one,” he said
at last, “this outbreak seems to be the
climax to a long course of morbid
thinking.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You cannot understand,” she said
faintly.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>“I confess I cannot, altogether. When you
married me you were no ignorant girl—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Humphrey,” she cried, her eyes absolutely
burning on him, “I did not think
that I should have to defend myself to
you in this! I thought you would know
the absolute ignorance of girls. It is no
veiled ignorance, it is absolute, or else a
mere vague—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dear, it was a cowardly and an unjust
reproach. However, things have now come
to a head with us, it is no use delaying,
you want, I gather, a separation?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She started.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I thought I would like to go home
for a time—alone.”</p>

<p class='c000'>For a minute Strange considered. “This
is no time for softness or entreaty,” was
the result of his reflections.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“We need have no legal separation,
Gwen—as yet,” he added, with slow
emphasis.</p>

<p class='c000'>She trembled from head to foot, he saw
it but went on calmly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are not strong enough now for
any trouble of that sort, but later on, of
course, some arrangement must be come
to. By the way, what will your father
and mother say of this?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They will not say anything,” she said
bitterly, “they will silently wonder together
in the library.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And Dacre—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dacre is a fool.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The world?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>He felt quite interested in the answer,
the shock was beginning to freeze the
pith in him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“I don’t think the world will speak of
me, I have no quality it can seize on for
gossip. No gossip has any savour unless
it deals with sexual relations and until
now I thought I was absolutely sexless,”
she said slowly, looking blankly out into
space.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her face was awful, her husband turned
away from it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen, Gwen,” he said at last, coming
back to her, “do you understand what
you are doing?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do,” she said heavily, “I cannot
bear this shame in your presence, I should
lie down and die under it. Can you think
I do this lightly, can you not understand
the awfulness of speaking such things
aloud?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I understand it all, dear, but have you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>counted the cost, you will be weak and
ill, perhaps in danger, can you bear it
all? If you finally decide to go alone to
your home I will start the same day for
Africa. I have been asked to undertake
that expedition for the relief of Broad, my
old friend, the missionary I told you about.
I do not intend to treat this resolve of
yours as a freak, Gwen, or to give it the
grace of one. You are a strong woman
and from your own point of view, sane.
Once again, have you counted the
cost?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have lived virtually alone all my
life,” she said, “I think I can bear sickness
and pain alone. Humphrey, Humphrey,
let me make one excuse for myself? I
did not know what marriage was when
I tried my experiment.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>He looked down on her upturned face
with a great tenderness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t blame you, dear. You are
sinning terribly, but you know not what
you do. Your sin is unnatural, for it
is against yourself, you have let a morbid
spot in you grow sick to rottenness, and
as time goes on, child, you will suffer
as few women know how to suffer,
you are sinning ignorantly, and your
punishment will come, but from another
hand than mine. But there is one thing
I will speak of,” he said, with grave
sternness, “see that you are not ashamed
of your motherhood. Forget, if you like,
that the child is in part mine, do not
forget that it is wholly yours, bone of
your bone, flesh of your flesh, beware, at
least, of sinning knowingly. You have had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>a warning, Gwen, in this, profit by it,
don’t let this child grow up without
knowing the everyday uses of a mother.
Don’t let any other human creature suffer
in this as you have suffered.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen listened to him with bent head,
and every word dropped into her soul
like molten lead.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was an awful resistless finality
in every word of his, in every tone. He
had to stoop to catch her answer, and her
face was almost livid.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will try and be a good mother, I
have no wish to fail in every relation
of life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t move until I return,” said her
husband.</p>

<p class='c000'>He went into the dining-room and
brought back some wine. She turned on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>him a look of dumb protest, but she
drank it. “And now, come to this sofa
and lie down.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She obeyed him as if she were in a
dream, wishing with vague pain that he
would touch her, even if it were only
once.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a few minutes she turned from
the light to shut out his face. He heard
her, and drew down the blind softly; he
seemed to her all-hearing as well as all-seeing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, if only he were a fool!” she
cried to herself, “I might endure it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The room was cool and still, and the
lowered blinds flapping lazily in the breeze
were like a lullaby. Gwen was worn
out body and mind, and as she lay in
the coolness, her hurt heart stopped writhing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>her poor foolish shame ceased to
burn, her fingers relaxed softly and forgot
to clench themselves, and at last she
fell asleep like a tired child.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her husband went softly to the sofa,
she started slightly, and a twist of pain
came into her brow. He smiled grimly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Even in her sleep,” he muttered, “and
I am ready to swear that all the time
it is only an idea. And now this child—the
best shot in my locker, seems about
to run an awful mucker in the business.
Ah, Gwen, if you only knew what you
cast from you in your splendid way!—Ah
well, there’s one satisfaction, if you’re
not mine, my Gwen, you’re no man’s.
Ah, my poor Gwen, my darling, God
keep you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He stooped down over her and for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>minute or two let her breath come and
go on his cheek, then he stood up and
went to his writing-table, and let his face
fall heavily into his hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he looked up at last at a slight
soft rustle of silk, there had gone out
of it for ever the look of cool buoyant
youth, which was its distinguishing characteristic.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Gwen awoke the blinds were
up and it was dusk, and the tea had just
been brought in.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Three hours at the very least,” she
thought with much discomfort, as she
sipped her tea, “and watched by him the
whole time!”</p>

<p class='c000'>When she had finished her tea she
was rising to leave the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her husband stopped her.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“Will you please sit down again for a
few minutes?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The dressing bell has gone,” she said
unwillingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That doesn’t matter,” he said, “we
can be late for once. I fancy,” he went
on coolly, “that your pride is of a sufficiently
rational and well-bred order not
to think itself obliged to make any difficulties
about money matters.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will do as you wish in the matter.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And if any emergency arises requiring
your interference, will you consent to act?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” she said simply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And now,” he said, “comes the question
of how this business is to be presented
to the world.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She raised her head impatiently. “The
world won’t trouble itself with me.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“You’ll escape better than most women,
but you won’t get off scot-free, you are
a woman and the world is the world. I
will make the matter right at the Clubs;
you want to go to your mother for a
short time, and I wish to go to Africa
where delays are apt to occur, and I
have a convenient reputation for vagabondage.
If I were you I would immediately
inform every woman of your acquaintance
of our arrangement in a candid
spirit of information. And, Gwen, as
the most awful misfortune that ever befell
a child is to be cast on the world without a
mother, see that your care for this mother’s
health, and when the time of peril comes
for her life, is as great as mine would be.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall not betray your trust in any
way,” she said quietly.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“I shall not trouble you to write, I
shall find other means of hearing of you.
But even if you are dying, Gwen, and
I know it, I shall not come to you
unless you distinctly and in your right
mind ask me to do so; then, dear, I
shall come; otherwise, and later on, we
can make definite arrangements. Good-bye,
Gwen, good-bye, dear.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He went to the door and held it open
to let her pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>She paused and turned her two sad
eyes on him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go, child,” he said gently, “go quickly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When she had gone he locked the
door and fell on the sofa, still warm
from her sleeping body, and fought down his
agony in decent silence. Then he washed
and dressed, and went down to his dinner.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The</span> next day Strange went down and told
Mrs. Fellowes more or less about it, and
put his wife entirely into her hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>People were less surprised than might
have been supposed at Strange’s suddenly-organized
expedition. He had broken conventional
laws now for so long that if he
had settled down into a solid every-day life,
without some characteristic protest, he would
have been regarded rather as a fraud.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>The first possible companion his thoughts
fell on, was Brydon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It would be bringing him out into the
wilderness with a vengeance,” he said, and
as a matter of fact it was just what
Brydon wanted at the time, and he was
overjoyed at the offer.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Tolly heard of the proposed move,
he came to a firm resolve to be in it.
At first Strange absolutely refused to take
him, but at last his persistence became so
annoying that he gave in, but not till Tolly
had taken the most powerfully-expressed
oaths of abstinence.</p>

<p class='c000'>When all this was settled, Tolly looked
up with a grin and remarked deprecatingly,</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you ’adn’t given in to take me
straight, I meant to reach you crooked at
Suez, sir, I never intended, your honour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>to let you face them black varmint, without
me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange looked at the hideous grinning
creature, that one good puff of wind could
blow off the face of the earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you know you are an idiot,
Tolly?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir,” said Tolly cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And that you’re very likely going to
your death?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not when you’re about, sir; death
and you ain’t mates.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’re to go with Bell to-day and
get rigged out,” said Strange.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir, thank your honour, but I’ve
took notice of them pants and sich as
were sent to your honour and ’ave hordered
the same for myself barrin’ a worser
quality.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“Well, upon my word!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Arrivin’ at Suez without nothin’ to
suit the climate might ’ave inconvenienced
your honour,” remarked Tolly, with bland
consideration. “I have likewise perwided
a breechloader and a rewolver.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, have you? Bring me those
weapons without a moment’s delay, and
then go with Bell and get your outfit; I pay
for those pants, and now, don’t go about
the place crowing over the other servants.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh Lord, sir, if you were to hear
them over my teeth you’d take back that
order. Seein’ likewise that the teeth
came out of your honour’s own pocket
and are a credit to your establishment, as
the dentist hisself said.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you be good enough to go to
the devil, Tolly, I’m busy.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>“Yes, sir,” said Tolly, and he took
himself off to crow conscientiously the rest
of the day.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the next two months Gwen comported
herself to the satisfaction of no one; she
was reticent with the Fellowes, and her
mother simply appalled her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Waring’s nervous gentle little
attempts at being a mother; the delicate
tendrils she kept constantly throwing
out in her daughter’s direction; her queer
quaint experiments in the expression of
the emotions, simply worried Gwen to
death. She refused to let herself
see the pathos of it all, or to be
touched.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed, as time went on and her weakness
grew more apparent to others, the demeanour
of her mother grew into a terror to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>her. She would fly from it to her own
room where she would sit with her idle
hands lying in her lap, in a quiet agony
of loneliness.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a point of honour with her to
keep herself calm; she ate and drank too,
and she rested obediently whenever Mary,
who had taken the physical part of her
under her charge, said she needed rest;
she drove when the old woman prescribed
air, and walked when movement was
supposed to be necessary. She was a
mere automaton in her absolute yielding
to orders concerning her health.</p>

<p class='c000'>During this time Mr. Waring made a
wild attempt to expand into a father. He
would issue from time to time from
his library with a bundle of random
papers in his hand, and entertain Gwen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>with discourse, grave and gay, mostly
concerning Africa, of which continent he
had rather a poor opinion and which he
painted with lurid colours.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he reeled out anecdotes of the
gruesomeness of the climate, the impracticability
of travelling, the hideous
forms diseases assumed, the congenital
villany of the natives, more especially
of that portion of the land into which
Strange meant to penetrate, and of
which he certainly possessed a most intimate
knowledge, Gwen used to watch
him with a curious cold sort of pain, and
wonder if he were human, till one day
Mrs. Fellowes found out the existence
of these ghastly entertainments and stopped
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>One morning when Mr. Waring was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>thus engaged, his wife sped away in a
half furtive fashion and shut herself into
the children’s nursery. Kneeling down
by the drawers she began to pull out great
heaps of soft white lawn and lace and
creamy flannel, then with much puzzled
doubt she set to sorting the things into
little heaps, each after its kind; when that
was done she went softly out, and in a
few minutes returned with old Mary.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Has my daughter provided herself with
those little things?” she asked nervously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know, ma’am, I was thinking
of speaking to her on the subject.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“These are good, are they not, the lace
seems to me to be real and I do not see
any holes?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lord, ma’am, they are like new, it
isn’t likely that I’d have my clothes torn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>after two babies, I’ve brought a set
through six, ma’am!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do the fashions in these things change,
Mary?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bless you, no, ma’am! Set up long-clothes
babies with fashions!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mary, would you be good enough to
get me a pretty basket?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You couldn’t have a prettier one than
this one, ma’am,” said Mary, pulling out
the old lace and muslin one that had held
the belongings of her own baby children.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Waring took up the thing and
examined it curiously, and thought of the
awe with which she used to regard it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do babies nowadays use these things?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lord, ma’am, yes, and will till the
millennium.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Mrs. Waring put the little things in
delicately, one by one.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now, Mary, I will take them to my
daughter,” she said with a little quiver
of her lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>She knocked gently at her daughter’s
door.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it happened she could hardly have
come at a worse time. Gwen had just
escaped from her father; besides, for
three weeks now, there had come no
news from Strange, and in spite of
herself she was all on edge with unnamed
terrors.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Mrs. Waring’s knock came, she
was sitting listlessly looking out of the
window.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I am so sickeningly tired,” she
said, “and I wish she would not always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>knock in that tremulous way.” She
hardened her face and threw the door
open.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her mother gave a quick little swallow
and came forward falteringly, while Gwen
still held the door open and watched her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you please close the door, dear
Gwen?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen complied, and then came towards
the basket and lifted one of the white
frilly things carelessly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly the truth flashed on her
and she trembled with indignation, while
her mother stood pathetically before her,
like a criminal at the bar.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen was the first to speak; her
mother’s face touched her in a vague way.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Won’t you sit down, mother?” she
said, in her cold gentle voice. “Do you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>wish me to have these things? I am so
very much obliged to you. I ordered
some before I left London, but I believe
it is always better to have a reserve
stock of everything.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I thought I would like to see a child of
yours in the little things,” faltered her
mother.</p>

<p class='c000'>A horrible feeling came on Gwen that
her mother was about to cry. She took
out one or two of the things.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is lovely lace,” she said hurriedly,
“better than any the woman showed me.
I had no idea you had any interest in
such matters.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then one fervent wish took possession
of her, that her mother would complete
her gift and go, but she was not to be
delivered just yet.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Mrs. Waring was on her way to
the door with bowed head, when suddenly
with a short smothered cry she
turned and faced her daughter. She
saw the quick recoil in the girl’s face,
and with a supreme effort the small
fragile creature calmed herself and sat
down.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen,” she said, looking at the tall
woman brooding gloomily above her, then
at the basket on the bed, “will you try
to suffer my love, dear? I cannot ask you
for yours, I have not earned it, I never
knew what it was to be a mother till
too late. But, dear, take the love I bear
you gently, don’t recoil from me as you
did just now,”—Gwen winced—“as you’ve
done many times. I will not intrude on
you, dear, I have made a mistake to-day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>in asking you to accept those things.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no, mother,” interrupted the girl.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, dear, I have, I do not reproach
you, but you are hard, and that fault is
mine more than yours. When you were
a little child, Gwen, did you ever wish
for my love—I mean the ordinary outspoken
natural love that women give their
children?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Waring bent forward and looked
into her daughter’s face with wide eager
eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen looked into the upturned face and
her heart stirred with pity, then a dreary
feeling came on her, that the time was too
solemn for lies.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I longed for it every day that I lived,”
she said in a slow reluctant voice, turning
away.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“Ah, and now it is too late! I did
cling to that last delusion, I did hope that
in the careless vigour of childhood, in the
fresh joy of a young animal, you might
have forgotten to want the outward signs
of mother-love. Gwen, Gwen dear, let
your child grow into your heart with
every breath, and God keep you from
suffering such as mine!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She stood up softly and was about to
go, but Gwen stopped her,</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mother,” she cried, “you couldn’t be
expected to understand children, you were
meant for intellectual uses altogether! It
seems to me hard and unjust that you
should now be hampered with these feelings.
Why can you not go back to your
old peaceful life? You were happy in it,
now your work is interfered with, and you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>are not happy. I wish I could do anything
for you, I wish I could satisfy you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, dear, you don’t know how very
little love would still my pain, but I don’t
think that even if you would, you could
give it to me—I don’t think you understand,
dear, what love is.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mother,” said the girl, in a low curiously
soft tone, “I do not.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Directly she had made the confession
a horrible feeling of shame came on her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She knows everything of me there
is to know now!” she thought, with a
dull ache, “I wonder what use she will
make of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After a long wait she got some little
idea. Her mother came and stood beside
her silently for a minute or two, then
she stooped down and kissed the girl’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>hand tremulously, took up her basket with
its burden, and went out of the room and
upstairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen looked at the little dent made
by the basket on the bed, and a new rush
of loneliness flooded her.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>There</span> was always a sort of studious
hush over Waring Park encompassing the
whole place as in a garment, but one day
a change crept suddenly into the nature of
the hush, it lost all at once in culture
and grew full of trembling awe; for
Mrs. Waring lay upstairs on her great
oak bed, her blue eyes looking out
of her thin face full of a piteous
longing.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>She had only a slight attack of pleurisy,
nothing to account for her quick run down,
but her heart was very weak and irregular,
the old doctor said, and he asked for an
opinion from town.</p>

<p class='c000'>The shock of the thing had a queer
effect on Mr. Waring, even from a physical
point of view.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he sat hour by hour and watched
her in a dumb vague horror, one hand
always in his, <em>his</em> breath came in short
gasps with strong pain, <em>his</em> eyes grew
congested, <em>his</em> lips turned a dull blue,
and dried and cracked, the very blood
slowed in his veins.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old doctor sounded him anxiously
as soon as he noticed his condition, and
found his lungs as sound as a bell. It
was only that the two were absolutely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>one flesh; she could suffer nothing and
leave him untouched. She was so sorry
for him and whenever she could gather
up her strength for the effort, she put
a great strain on herself to breathe
naturally, but hour by hour her power
over herself grew less, and her breathing
more constantly laborious.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Gwen? Fear had found her at
last, and it tore and tortured her. She
knew very little of sickness, and in this
sickness of her mother’s there was a pale
ghastly shade of some other thing that
touched the infinities.</p>

<p class='c000'>She went in and out of her mother’s
room in a vague search after duty, but
she never touched even her bed; she
was afraid of the awful shadowy thing,
and more afraid still of her mother’s eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>following her hungrily. No softening
grew in her eyes, no love—only fear.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so the days wore on and the
hush fell closer round the house, and crept
into the hearts of those that dwelt there.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet there seemed small cause for it all,
the doctors saw no tangible reason for
alarm, and yet they were uneasy and came
frequently.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the eighth day of the illness,
just as twilight was falling.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Waring had had her bed moved
near the window that commanded the
Park, and she was looking wistfully out
on to the south terrace watching Gwen
walking up and down.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen, in obedience to her promise to
take care of herself, always chose this
particular walk, bathing herself in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>sunlight and drinking in great draughts of
the sweet clear air that came across a
heathy hill in the distance, and trying to
gather up shreds of happy thought to feed
her loneliness with, and to soothe the vague
aching that seemed to have made its home
in her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mary,” said Mrs. Waring suddenly,—her
husband had been literally dragged
out for a drive by the old doctor—“will
you call Gwen, but first give me that
tonic. I feel as if I would slip away in
spite of myself, and I know,” she murmured
softly to herself, “there is something I
ought to say.—Are her eyes still sealed
as she walks there communing with her
own sad heart?” she thought as she looked
out at Gwen. “Will love never touch her—never?
Will the child’s life open the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>gate—or—must it be the death of that
little child?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She shivered down into the bedclothes,
and shut her eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ma’am, dear heart, drink this,” said
Mary, softly raising her, and with a
great leap of her heart she saw death
on the white face, “drink it, my dearie,”
she repeated returning unconsciously to
the old term of thirty-nine years ago,
and kissing the little furrows between
the brows. “You are very young, dearie,”
she said, softly stroking her hair, “not
fit to be a grandmother!”</p>

<p class='c000'>A soft pink flush crept into her cheeks.
“Will you please call Gwen?” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Gwen came in, her mother’s eyes
were closed and her face like marble.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>The girl shivered and half turned; a
horrible inclination to fly took hold of
her, but she drove back her cowardice
and came swiftly up to the bed, one of
her full sleeves touched it, and she drew
it away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her mother’s eyes opened just in time
to see her little action, she shivered,
and Gwen’s heart began to ache in a
new spot.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It all seems so hopeless,” she thought,
“it is so terrible to hurt her, so pitiless,
and underbred.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She stooped over her, a tress of hair
escaped from her coil and fell on Mrs.
Waring’s cheek. Neither of them touched
it for a minute.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mother felt a sudden longing to
ruffle it softly as she had once done to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>a village baby’s, and to feel the soft
silkiness slip through her fingers, but she
restrained herself and only breathed a
little quicker.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You want me, mother?” said Gwen
gently, lifting up her head and fastening
up her hair.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I want you, dear.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She closed her eyes and rested. Gwen
moved uneasily, the stillness oppressed
her, and some change in the sick woman’s
face made her heart feel tight.
Presently Mrs. Waring drew a long breath
and threw off some of the clothes feebly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are so heavy,” she said. Mary
lifted her higher on the pillows. “Yes,
that’s better, thank you, and now, Mary,
go and rest. My daughter will stay
with me.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Gwen heard the resolute masterful use
of the word, in absolute terror; she had
a coerced, trapped feeling, and for a minute
a passionate revolt shook her. What was
she to do, to say; she felt as if she were
caught in a mesh of bleeding quivering
nerves, she found herself drawing her
breath almost imperceptibly, for fear of
touching raw surfaces.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is it, mother?” she cried out.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a tone of appeal in her voice,
born of her terror. This strengthened
her mother; she felt older than her child
and with the power to protect her. The
ghost of a smile moved her mouth and
flickered in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is death, dear,” she said, with gentle
gravity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen stared at her and in an uncomprehending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>rigid way she repeated—“Death,
death!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” whispered the woman, “it is
hard to realize—I have been so strong, but
life has been losing its hold on me for
some time, I think. Gwen, let me take
your hand, dear, touch me as if you were
used to it, as if you had tumbled over
me and I had played with you ever
since you can remember.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen’s hand shook as she gave it with
white lips and wide eyes. What was
that growing shadow on the small face,
what was this bringing such confidence,
such a curious compelling air of possession
into the timid eyes?</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Waring gave a soft far-away little
laugh, that made Gwen’s blood turn in the
ghastly listening silence.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“I saw the other day a young mother,
a little creature with blue eyes and yellow
hair and so young—so young—put her
little baby’s fingers into her mouth, and
bite them softly in play, and the baby
laughed and kicked. <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jubelte!</span></i> Why
does English sometimes fall so short? Ah,
Gwen, I wish you could have seen it,
nothing is like it, nothing—”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen stirred in anguish, her brain was
surging wildly, her whole heart and soul
were prostrate in one wild prayer for
help from the horrors that were closing
her in. There was no idea of God in
the prayer, however.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Humphrey, Humphrey, Humphrey!”
was the only thought that possessed her,
and tried to break aloud in sound through
her dry lips.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Then her mother’s eyes closed again
and she murmured in her half sleep; when
she aroused herself after a few minutes
her gentle eyes were bright and wild.
She caught Gwen’s dimpled pink fingers
and put them into her mouth and she set,
to bite them softly and to kiss them with
little ripples of a girl’s laughter, and her
few wrinkles smoothed themselves and
the sweet rosy colour came again into
the thin cheeks, and she was a careless,
happy young mother playing with her
first child.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Waring had come softly into the
room some minutes before; he paused and
peered eagerly forward, and then there leapt
into his eyes a blinding agony; he swayed,
shivering, and dropped on his knees by
the bed. But of this Gwen saw nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>As her mother kissed, and bit, and
mumbled over her hand, and half sang
little quaint snatches of baby song, and
took her pretty fingers one by one
and told them with low silvery laughs
“this little pig went to market and the
other stayed at home!” and broke out
into a louder ripple as “the little one
cried queak!” her own baby “leapt in her
womb” and the scales fell from her eyes
and her heart melted within her, and the
breast of her dying mother was as an
open book to her; she could read all the
love there and the remorse and the infinite
sorrow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen’s heart stopped and her breath
refused to come—she would have died
then. Her soul hovered shuddering on the
threshold of life, but her baby stirred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>imperiously and pulled it back, and then
a torrent of tears came to her help and
left her with soft moist eyes, a child by
her mother’s side.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mother, oh, mother!” the infinite
tenderness in her voice smote into her own
heart, and made Mr. Waring rise quickly
and wait trembling with fear and a great
awe, “mother, oh my darling—speak—touch
me—love me, your child, Gwen—!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will not let thee go unless thou
bless me.” The picture involuntarily rose
before Mr. Waring’s eyes as he murmured
the words.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Speak to me once, mother—I know
everything, now—everything—do you hear,
darling?”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the mother still kissed and played
with the trembling clinging fingers, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>sang her soft old songs, and her eyes
looked up full of sunny irresponsible
happiness, and saw things of which we
have not thought in our philosophy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mother, oh my mother!”—but still
she babbled on, smiling.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Waring came forward with bowed
head, silent, in fearful reverence.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not for him to speak or interfere,
the ground whereon he stood was
holy ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mother, mother, mother!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The babbling had now grown drowsy
and low, and Gwen had to bend close to
catch it, then it ceased, and the mother
lay very still. Gwen turned in terror and
saw her father.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Help, help!” she cried, “she must
speak—oh, God! she must!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Her father took her hand, and bending
softly he took her mother’s, and held the
two in his, and one soft shivering moan
broke from him; then father and daughter
stood in the palpitating silence and
waited breathless, but the silence grew
and spread like a net around them, crushing
hearts, and the breathing of the woman
grew less and less and her face whiter,
and then a strong cry rent the veil of
awful silence and Gwen fell forward as
one dead on her mother’s breast.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Was</span> ever grief like unto my grief!”
has been the cry of each wrung heart
throughout all ages—the truth is, there is
a dreary family likeness among them all,
and a horrible absence of originality.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this particular Gwen Strange could
score over the whole sad brood, her
grief was aloof, alone, it differed in every
point from the kindly race of men, it
had no balm and less outlet, she could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>not cry nor strive, she could not throw
her whole soul against fate and fall
back with the pain dulled from sheer
tiredness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every day with the little white mother
lying cold on her bed, she still walked
in the sun on the south terrace, and cherished
her child, but virtue had gone out
of her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She will kill me,” Mrs. Fellowes told
her husband, “if she looks like that long!
she’s not tragic, not an atom, nor dramatic;
I think she must look like Dante did
when he stood before the gates of Saint
Ilario.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, one hardly dares think of the
girl, walking, and eating, and sleeping; and
she looks younger than ever I saw her.
What is <em>he</em> doing now? I must go up soon.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>“Sitting holding her hand, except when
he is told to come to his meals. Of
course, knowing the man, one could
describe his grief to a T. It’s just himself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What will time do for the two, I
wonder?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is something gone from Gwen
that no time will give back to her: I
wish, oh, I wish I knew how it was at
the end. Did that woman go down into
the grave still seeking her lost motherhood?
Oh, John, John, God in Heaven help
women! I wonder if He knew quite
everything when He made us, He is all
masculine. I don’t think He altogether
did or He would have stayed His hand
and have had mercy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My little Ruth, my poor little wife,
life even for us is hard!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>“But it is simpler, it is the complications
which put barbs on our arrows, the
vague yearnings quivering in us ignorantly,
not with the knowledgeable, healthy hammer-strokes
of men’s anguish; and our
bodies are nearer our souls. Think of
Gwen with her unborn child under that
heartful of unnameable pain! John, it’s
only three o’clock—will you drive me
into the town, the market is full on—I
must see some women who are too stolid
for nerves—oh—the letters, and one from
Humphrey! John, he’s down with fever,
and Brydon’s only half way through!</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Not a man-jack of the blacks—being
mostly christianized—is worth his salt, only
for Tolly we’d cave in altogether, the
fellow’s a brick, and seems like developing
the beginnings of an intellect, just in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>nick of time too; never in all my life was
I so knocked into a cocked hat as by
this fever.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look at the writing, John, it’s
shocking.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘As for Brydon, he had a narrow
squeak, he’s out of the bush now, but
as weak as a rat. On the whole
the sand flies are worse than the fever.
Don’t dwell on this touch of fever to Gwen,
it’s really of no consequence, but it’s an
awful nuisance on account of the delay.
From here we go on to a place about
a hundred miles off, to where we have
traced Broad. Hitherto the blacks have
been friendly but beyond the hills I hear we
are to look out for squalls. Don’t expect
many letters after this, as the modes of
conveyance are very casual and untrustworthy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>neither can I count upon receiving
our letters safely. I will hurry there
and back with all possible speed. I know you
will always see Gwen at least once a day.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“See, John, I can hardly read it, what
is it? Oh, ‘love for you’ and something
for the rector I can hardly read.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will go in on our way to the market;
the ponies are at the door.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen was in her boudoir when Mrs.
Fellowes went to her. She was sitting
with a bundle of papers in her hand. She
thrust them into a drawer, and ran and
as it were got into the other woman’s
arms, and lay there with a short audible
movement of pain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell me just how you think my husband
is,” she said. Mrs. Fellowes started. “Ah,
you’re afraid too!” cried Gwen.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“Gwen, I know really very little; those
attacks are always very sharp, hardly
ever dangerous except with bad constitutions,
John says—he has been reading up
a medical book about African fevers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Bad constitutions and complications,’
the book says, I have it; and he has a
complication in some sort of sunstroke.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” she went on in a quiet level
voice. “He missed the last mail by some
idiocy of the blacks, and he walked ten
miles all through a swamp to catch it,
with the fever still on him; when he
got home he was half delirious. He lay
and it seems turned his heart inside out,
both audibly and on paper, see, I have it
all here in these sheets!” she said, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>bitter irony, catching her breath, as she
took them out of the drawer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen, my Gwen, what do you
mean?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I mean he lay there and told out into
words—blatant awful English words—on to
these sheets, how he loves me, me! but in
words no other man ever before used, or
dared to use, or the soul of every loved
woman would have been annihilated long
ago, they are not fitted to bear such
magnificent burdens!—He told, too, in
precisely the same uncompromising way
what he wants of me, and what he considers
I am capable of in this line. Mrs.
Fellowes, I know just exactly what it
cost him to go away! Nothing is hid.
Then yesterday—”</p>

<p class='c000'>She stood up rather wildly—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“Do you know that yesterday I learned
in one choking gulp the grinding truth
of my mother’s poor tragedy of life,
I learned too,” she said slowly, throwing
out her arms softly, with a pathetic gesture
of appeal, “all in one blinding second
my own infinite love for her; but there
was no time to tell, she died first. I
am crushed with knowledge, I am spared
nothing, and then—ah, sickness is degrading!
Delilah’s shears are nothing to
it! To think that here in my hands I
hold the whole unsuppressed heart of a
man!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But, Gwen, I cannot grasp it—how
came you by all this knowledge? Humphrey
was too ill to write all that big
bundle of sheets.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He wrote, as he spoke, in delirium,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>part of it is absolutely maniacal, but my
God! there is truth enough in it! I see
Humphrey’s poor sick naked soul in every
line!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She hid her face and moaned softly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But, love, I don’t understand—how
came you by those sheets?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Brydon sent the letters. Poor boy,
he wrote a little humble scrawl himself,
that has a touch of pathos in it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think Brydon was the more delirious
of the two! What business has he meddling
in matters too big for him!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, he’s young and very romantic,
and—have you ever heard of that picture
he painted of me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That sketch for your mother?” she
said softly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen winced.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“No, oh no, one he came down and
made of me the day I was married. It
is not me at all, it is a beautiful sexful
mother-woman, it was to that woman
Humphrey wrote those things! I am the
rival of my own picture.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Fellowes jumped up and knelt, weeping
bitterly, at Gwen’s knees.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen, send for Humphrey, you are
his first duty, he will come in spite of
that miserable missionary who never had
any business venturing his nose where
no one wanted it—he will come to you
at once!”</p>

<p class='c000'>For a second Gwen stared frozenly
at her then she drew herself a little
away.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But why, why should I?” she asked.
“Can you not see, my God! can you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>not see that I am not ready for him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The cold gray of her face turned to a
vivid red, and she got up hastily and went
to the window.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Gwen’s</span> duty-forced efforts to comfort her
father, were incessant, and rather tragic;
he said very little and worked his usual
number of hours conscientiously at his
latest work, but the best part of him was
away. His head bowed a little more
every day, his step fell a little more heavily,
his eye lost a fresh spark of life; he was
following his wife in his patient, well-bred
manner, with neither cry nor moan.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Sudden fits of half compunctuous duty
would now and again seize upon him, and
remind him that he had a daughter who also
knew sorrow, then he would pursue Gwen
softly, and catch her, no matter how
inconvenient it might be, and ply her
with questions on embarrassing topics.
Gwen was very gentle with him and used
to do him small services with a curious
shy anxiety that had a touch of motherliness
in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day late in August Mrs. Fellowes
was sitting down for a brief rest, when
to her astonishment Gwen was announced,
she had never sought her of her own
accord since her mother’s death.</p>

<p class='c000'>She sat down now quite naturally,
and looked round the room with a pleased
smile.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>“Ah! you have altered that bracket, it
used to be in the other corner! And the
piano, I hardly know if I like it there—I
believe I do. I wonder why my tea
is never an atom like yours, is it the
cream, or the cups, or what?”</p>

<p class='c000'>When she had drunk her tea she put
the cup down and said suddenly, “I would
like to go to Strange Hall next week,
will you come with me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Next week!” repeated Mrs. Fellowes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I know this sudden move looks
rather insane, but I have been thinking
it over for some time. The child is
Humphrey’s, it has a right to be born in
the home of its father, and—and—I
cannot go without you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shouldn’t dream of letting you, my
Gwen, only you took me by surprise.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Mary will go too, of course, but what
about your father?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen looked disturbed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know. Do you think my
going or staying will make much difference
to him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do, dear, a very great difference,
but he will think as I do, now you have
spoken, that you are doing right. When
we are away John will be with him
every moment he can spare.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“As if I didn’t know that!” Gwen said.
“I will tell him to-night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>To the amazement of them all, Mr.
Waring, as soon as he had grasped the
situation, rose to it in a quite remarkable
way; the proceeding on Gwen’s part
struck him as most fit and proper, and he
braced himself up to support her. He also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>announced his intention of accompanying
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortège</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first shock of his resolve Gwen
winced; the fact of carrying him in her
train and on such an errand brought a
spice of ludicrousness into the affair that
seemed to her ghastly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The day before they started she surprised
him in the study, grasping in one
hand a heap of manuscript in her mother’s
pretty hand-writing and reading with knit
brows a copy of Chavasse’s “Advice to a
Mother.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was too much for Gwen, she
escaped to her room, and cried and laughed,
and cried and laughed again in a perfect
paroxysm of grief and piteous amusement.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was in the end quite a toss-up as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Gwen’s ever seeing her baby at all, she
hovered so long on the borders of death.
Her silent lonely enduring anguish had
shattered her more than any of them had
guessed, and then, as ill-luck would have
it, the first sound that struck on her
ear when consciousness was coming back
was the shrill shriek of her lusty boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>She shuddered down again into the
regions of darkness, and it was only after
two distracting hours that they got her
back among them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Day after day she held the child and
pondered over it; she was very gentle,
and ate and drank in an absent way all
that was given her, but she hardly
spoke at all, some leaven was working
in her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then this haunting, sweet-bitter pain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>is motherhood,” she thought, the first day
she was up, as she watched the sleeping
child gobbling a red fist, “and it’s for
this that one half the women in the
world live and brood Madonna-like over
their infants, with that awful peace in
their eyes which takes the commonness
from the most common of them! Goodness,
what wouldn’t I give for just the
merest knowledge of that motherhood that
rests and broods and commands the world!
That painted wretch downstairs is teeming
with it, and—it’s bitter, it’s terrible,
to want your mother as I want mine
now, to teach me the meaning of motherhood!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She stood up, and leaned forward over
the baby.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If this feeling grows much more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>in me I shall go mad,” she murmured,
“I am not quite sane now. Baby, my
own little baby, can’t you help me,
to be in absolute touch with the beautiful
mysterious things that are the crown of
womanhood? Seemingly not,” she said
turning away, “with all your warm sweetness.
I believe I have a fair understanding
of this part of a mother, I could
make a fool of myself over the tiny thing
there, I could—Oh!—Mother, mother!
Can I never forget you over my hands!
Must a new heartache spring up every
hour? Is there rest nowhere?—Ah,
Humphrey, if only I weren’t myself and you
weren’t just you, I’d set off this minute
and find you!—Certainly I am mad,
and here are Mrs. Fellowes and Mary
upon me!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>About</span> a month after her child’s birth,
an urgent message came from Strange’s
steward to Lady Strange. He was very
ill and must see her.</p>

<p class='c000'>She drove to his house and found him
dying, and infinitely concerned that he
could not deliver up his stewardship into
his master’s hands. He was a man
who had always rather suffered from a
hypertrophied conscience, and perhaps he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>exaggerated the importance of his office,
and the impossibility of getting anyone to
follow him in it; at any rate he impressed
Gwen a good deal, and rather put her on
her mettle.</p>

<p class='c000'>After reviewing the situation, she came
to the conclusion that if no one else
could keep things straight she would
undertake to do it herself. As she took
off her things, a new complication
struck her; to do this she must be
on the spot, and how would that suit her
father?</p>

<p class='c000'>She was rather absent and full of the
question when she got down to tea, and
Mrs. Fellowes, as a sort of cure and antidote
to her wistful aloofness, went and
brought the baby. And then Mr. Waring
came in and contemplated it silently, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>he had done every day since it was
born.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen told them of Hopkins, and in a
rather shy tentative way spoke of her
project.</p>

<p class='c000'>To her astonishment Mr. Waring
woke up fully, and spoke with hearty
approval of it, then without giving her
a chance to reply, he went out but soon
returned with a large parcel of manuscript,
tied up laboriously with string, the
knots all over it in haphazard style.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is the book,” he said slowly,
and with frequent pauses, “on which we
have worked so long, it is at last complete.
It is sad, is it not, that it is only
I, who am here to see the end? I have
been more than once afraid that I should
be unable to finish it, it is hard to work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>alone, old habits are strong within us—I
will attempt no new work.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He swayed a little and leaned heavily
on the table. “You, my daughter,
have your work here, you must uphold
the house of your husband and of his
first-born; to-morrow I will go home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen attempted to say something, but
he motioned her to silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You may perhaps think your duty is
with me, it is not, it is here, and here
you must remain to guard your husband’s
lands, and to cherish his child. It is the
soul that is just entering life that needs
all your care, not that which is done
with it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he went and stood over the
child, and suddenly some vague old
feeling surged up in him and he raised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>his hands that trembled above its head,
and his lips were moved by a mute
blessing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Fellowes intended going herself
early that week as she was a good deal
wanted at home, but she could not bring
herself to leave Gwen entirely alone, and
then she had not heard a word of Humphrey
from his wife’s lips for more than a
month now, and his letters to her, after
one she got assuring her of his perfect
recovery, were anything but satisfactory,
they were short and dry and told her
nothing. Then, as the missionary he was
in pursuit of, had escaped through the
intervention of a tribe of friendly blacks
some other way, and was already on his
way home, probably preparing his experiences
for the religious press, Humphrey’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>continued presence in Africa was simply
ridiculous, and she was in a fever of
anxiety as to the next step of this most
trying couple.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few nights after, she was very glad
she had decided to remain.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had just fallen off into her first
sleep when she was awakened by a
violent shake, and found Gwen standing
above her white and rigid and too terrified
to speak. She pulled her out of the
room and into the nursery by her
nightdress sleeve, to show her her baby
in very bad convulsions in the nurse’s
arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole night through, the two
women watched the strange cruel possession
that twisted and contorted the
small flower-like face and the tender
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>limbs, and next day the spasms ceased
and a sharp attack of bronchitis set in.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen’s mute tense agony upset even
the old doctor, who as a rule was emotion-proof
enough; he would have given a
great deal to have been able to reassure
her, but he could not in conscience do so,
the child was about as dangerously ill as
it was possible for it to be.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he came of a lusty stock, and fought
gallantly for his life, while his mother hovered
breathless above him, and allowed no
one but herself to touch him for any service,
and when she absolutely could keep her
eyes open no longer, she would trust him
to no one but Mrs. Fellowes.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she fought desperately for her child’s
life, the girl for the first time in her
own, lost herself in supreme self-forgetfulness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>and then at last the latent truth
in her nature broke through its bonds
and unfolded itself hour by hour, and
overpowered though she was by grief
and terror on the child’s account, Mrs.
Fellowes blessed God and rejoiced.</p>

<p class='c000'>The splendid reserves of the girl’s
tenderness, her lovely frank abandonment
to her new-found motherhood, fairly staggered
the elder woman. She could hardly
keep control over herself, she felt so
small, so humble, so absolutely unfit to do
as she ought to do. There was to her
something most holy, most reverent in
the awakening of this virgin mother, she
felt almost indecent in her greedy absorption
of its regal loveliness, and this time
God did stay His hand and His heart
inclined itself to mercy.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Seven days after the beginning of the
illness a little ray of hope set to play
in the doctor’s eyes, and sent a wave of
new sweet life rushing through Gwen’s
veins.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day, and the next, this grew
and strengthened, and at the end of the
day after that the doctor spoke with
perfect confidence, and he added,</p>

<p class='c000'>“I never until now knew exactly how
much a mother’s love can do, Lady Strange.
You are an incomparable nurse.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When he went away Gwen still knelt
by the cot, with moist eyes, and looked
at the baby, who suddenly stirred, and
awoke, and began to watch her in that
terrible all-knowing way babies have, then
a little wavering ghost of a smile touched
its mouth. Gwen waited with parted lips,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>and the smile grew and took proper
tangible human shape, till the tender mouth
gave a little tremble with it and the eyes
widened, and suddenly, to Mrs. Fellowes’
horror, Gwen fell back against her in a
dead swoon.</p>

<p class='c000'>When she had recovered and they had
brought her to her room, she fell asleep at
once, and it was midnight when she awoke.</p>

<p class='c000'>She got up directly and stole softly
out to see her baby, who was sleeping
peacefully with Mrs. Fellowes on
guard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He couldn’t possibly be better,” she
whispered, “you must go back to bed at
once.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And you—you must too, you look
green with tiredness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She knelt down by the cot with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>little soft cooing sound that half frightened
herself, she turned her head to
find out where it came from, when she
knew she smiled up at Mrs. Fellowes,
and her eyes were radiant with a sweet
mystery.</p>

<p class='c000'>When she came in to see her baby
next morning she carried a telegram she
had just written, in her hand. It was to
Strange and very simple.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you come?” it said, “we want
you, baby and I.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Read it,” she said to Mrs. Fellowes,
“and will you send it yourself?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She stooped over the cot for a long
time, and nothing was to be seen of
her but the tips of two pink ears.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>How</span> soon can he come?” said Gwen,
when Mrs. Fellowes returned after sending
the message. “I have been counting up,
it must be three weeks even if he is
at the coast; if he is inland, it may be
longer. Now the missionary is safe, he
must be just hunting, he will be sure
to get my message without much
delay.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She spoke rapidly and walked about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>the room with her boy in her arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She hasn’t a doubt as to his reply to
her message,” thought Mrs. Fellowes;
“how absolutely she trusts him!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will he wonder when he sees I am
here—will he guess why I came?” she
went on in her glad excitement. “Darling,
sweet, beauty! What will he think of
you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen, sit down, or let me take him,
you are not perfectly strong yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am,” she cried, with a happy laugh,
“I am a giant refreshed with wine, a
whole volume of new life has flowed into
me, I could move the world at this moment,
not to say carry this mite. I am a woman
at last, a full, complete, proper woman, and
it is magnificent. No other living woman
can feel as I do; other women absorb
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>these feelings as they do their daily bread
and butter, and they have to them the
same placid everyday taste, they slip into
their womanhood; mine has rushed into
me with a great torrent—I love my husband,
I worship him, I adore him—do you hear,
my dear?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She stopped in her march, and turned
on Mrs. Fellowes a radiant triumphant
face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, if I hadn’t you to tell all this to,
I would go out into the fields and shout
it aloud. And what are <em>you</em> crying for,
I am not mad? I am, I suppose, what
Humphrey would call natural, but somehow
it makes me feel too big for the
room. Hold the child while I open the
windows.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Fellowes, as soon as she got hold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>of him, carried him off to the nursery,
and simply insisted on Gwen’s lying down
and holding her tongue.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you want to bring a fever on
yourself,” she demanded sternly, “and be
a scarecrow when Humphrey comes? You
are shockingly young, my Gwen!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She was sane after that, and tried to
behave as if nothing had happened to her,
but the change in her was quite visible
to the naked eye. Next day she buckled
to her steward’s work with a whole-hearted
dominance, that ensured success, and Mrs.
Fellowes went home to her husband big
with happy news.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c000'>When five weeks had passed, and she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>had neither message or sight of Humphrey,
Gwen’s magnificent abandonment of joy
had a break, and a trembling came into
it, and into her eyes a wave of fear, and
every time she came in from her work
in the village or on the home farm, she
betook herself to the baby to steady her
nerves.</p>

<p class='c000'>And then the press began to set flying
little gnat-like biting doubts as to Strange’s
unaccountable silence, after it was ascertained
through a long-delayed scrap of a
note to Mrs. Fellowes that he had joined
an ivory expedition into an unsettled
district. Then to add to her anxieties, the
missionary, grateful for his intended
capture, ran down to Strange Hall, and
being rather an ass, and having been left
with only the tail end of a constitution—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>solemn and gloomy one—he gave her a
most lurid and awful impression of those
parts into which Humphrey had penetrated.</p>

<p class='c000'>She put a brave front on, but she had
a shocking time of it, and her usual song
to her baby in exactly Humphrey’s tones
was,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dann willst du weine, du liebe kleine!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>which the baby looked upon as a huge joke.</p>

<p class='c000'>Week after week passed and not a word,
and then whisperings of relief expeditions
began to stir the papers, and Mrs. Fellowes
was hurrying up wildly with her work
to be able to get to Gwen.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last she came over from the station
in a fly, a day or two before she was expected,
and found Gwen in Strange’s den,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>which showed tokens of her all over the
place, playing with her child, now a big
fellow who beat the record in the matter
of crawling.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the nurse took him at last, Gwen
said to Mrs. Fellowes rather grimly,</p>

<p class='c000'>“The county considers I should wear
a widow’s cap, and sport crêpe, and my
horrible state of plumpness makes me to
stink in their nostrils. Just look at my
arms! I wish I could oblige them,” she
went on wearily, “and bear my woe
according to their rules of decency. Lady
Mary rolled down on me and stayed a
week, and never got out what she came
to say until I was putting her into the
railway carriage on her way back to London,
then she produced her rebuke on the
top of a sigh, and began a prayer, but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>train started before she got well into it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘My dear,’ she said, ‘I think that under
the circumstances a plain black gown and
a bonnet—hats to my mind are at present
unseemly—and then, my dear Gwen, if
by any means you could manage, ahem,
not to <em>add</em> to your plumpness—people in
our position must set an example—I assure
you, for myself, I lost eight pounds and
a half the first six months of my widowhood.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then she began her rather irrelevant
prayer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen, sit down, and I’ll make tea,
and tell you about your father.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen leant back in her chair and put
her hands to her hot head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I forget everything but myself and
this fattening misery of mine. He is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>failing very much, is he not? His letters
somehow have a fragile sound. They have
a horrible habit of making me howl, I
have got so maudlin I howl now quite
easily; he has been at ‘Chavasse’ again,
and to rather an awful extent.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, he is failing day by day, and
unfolding himself at the same time. I
never quite realized before how beautiful
and single-hearted his character is; he
comes now to see me, or rather to sit
and meditate in my presence, after he has
been to your mother’s grave, and when
he has sat and rested, he speaks of you.
You can gather the way, I fancy, from
his letters—oh, the quaintness, the pathetic
grotesqueness of his remarks!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have often wanted to ask you if
Mr. Fellowes ever brings his professional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>capacity to bear on my father?” asked
Gwen.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never. ‘Only God is fit to undertake
the care of such a soul as his,’ John
says, ‘neither he nor his soul are subject
to ordinary laws, each lives out the life
given it to live.’ Good gracious! fancy
John or any other parson attempting to
shove theology into such a nature, or to
dig down after his beliefs! Gwen, darling,
you may be in good condition, but how
very tired you look!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tired! Oh yes, I am, I cannot tell
you how tired! At first I used to live
in a whirl so as to tire myself, now
there’s no need of it, I am just as tired
when I get up as when I go to bed, and
nothing will drive the days on, and the
endlessness of life sickens one. I feel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>crêpey enough to please anyone, goodness
knows, but even if Humphrey never
comes, I will neither wear crêpe nor put
on any of the trappings of decent widowhood,
for I know he never got my message.
If he is dead, he died knowing nothing, I
am no honest widow of his, and I will wear
hats to the end of the chapter, and possibly
grow fat and outrival Lady Mary, who
knows!</p>

<p class='c000'>“You see, my life is a healthy one,
I ride miles a day all over the farms,
there isn’t a fact concerning manure I
couldn’t tell you; as to drainage, I feel
like turning into a pipe myself; I have
even a medicine chest, and doctor the
babies, Heaven help them! If I could
only follow him as he would me, it would
be less awful, but you see, there’s baby,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>my place is here, and I must just stand
and wait like those wretched creatures
in the hymn. As for those relief expeditions,
though I send cheques, I look
upon them as a farce, as if he wanted
to be caught and brought home like a
missionary!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It seems to me you are on the go
from morning to night, what time do you
leave yourself for sleeping?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, any amount, more than I want.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How long did you sleep last night?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I forget. Are you too tired to
drive to a farm about a mile away?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tired! No, dear,” stooping down and
kissing her, “but must you go? Lie down,
and let me read to you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Anything in the shape of tenderness
was just the one stroke too much for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Gwen, she gave a quick dry sob and
moved away.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can’t stand that sort of thing,” she
said, “I told you I had got maudlin.
Treat me as you would a nice orthodox
Christian widow, who wears crêpe and
caps and gets just to the proper state of
thinness, pulling herself up, however, just
short of scragginess like a self-respecting
creature. And now we must hurry, for
I hear the carriage.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She turned round as she was leaving
the room, and laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am altogether losing tone. Do you
know that young Will Dyer—Sir William’s
black sheep, whom I have been occupying
my spare moments in being a mother to, and
in trying to detach from the devil—began
yesterday to make violent love to me?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>“I don’t wonder!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good gracious me, why?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look at your face! You are a woman
now, my good Gwen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And is this the first result? God
help us! Is my one pride in life to
become a thorn in my flesh?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s as you take it! It will, unless
you are careful, be a very considerable
thorn in other people’s. Good gracious,
child, why even virtue in women is very
much a matter of temperament, and where
the temperament is, there will the opportunities
be gathered together.”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Late</span> one afternoon, two men, looking
unspeakably battered, got into a fly at a
small off station and told the man to
drive them to Strange Hall.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll not show to a soul for a week,”
said the first man, who, if one looked at
him microscopically, seemed like the
remains of Strange, “never in all my life
have I felt so humiliated. To be held by
the leg by a parcel of niggers for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>best part of four months, and at my age,
is too much for any fellow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You were next to off your head most
of the time, and then only for us you’d
have escaped long ago,” said Brydon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t try to find excuses, it’s too
damnable altogether, and to think after all
that those idiots got home months sooner,
laden with ivory!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“After the week what will you do?”
asked the other looking out of the window.
“You’ll show yourself to your people
directly you are presentable, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Give interviews to reporters probably,”
he returned shortly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brydon furtively watched the gaunt
shattered man, old before his time, who
not so very long before had looked as if
he could move the world.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>“Oh, that woman!” he thought savagely.</p>

<p class='c000'>Almost in spite of himself he had
become the keeper of all the elder man’s
secrets, and the office weighed frightfully
on him.</p>

<p class='c000'>By some extraordinary mischance,
neither the letters sent at that time, nor
the cablegram, ever reached Strange; they
came some time after the expedition had
gone, and in transmission were lost, and
the negligent messengers thought best to
entirely deny the existence of any.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Strange enquired at the office at
Cairo, there was no account of any cable
for him, the clerk who had received it had
been exchanged, and Strange made no very
pressing enquiry, for he hardly expected one,
and as a P. and O. boat was starting the
next hour, he took passage on her and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>went on board—even giving the reporters
the slip.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a matter of fact, he was so
desperately ill at the time that he was
hardly responsible for his actions, or he
must have recovered the record of the
cable, and both Brydon and Tolly were
too much occupied in the attempt to get
him home alive to think of anything else.
They succeeded as it turned out, but only
by the skin of his teeth.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the whole, despite certain eccentricities,
both Tolly and Brydon had done
better than any other men possibly could
have done, their sentimental devotion to
Strange put starch into their rather limp
souls, and their uncomplaining heroism
under the most shocking sufferings was
almost pathetic, and then by some special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>providence, they had both escaped the
second fever that nearly put an end to
Strange.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What’s that, do you see, in the field
there? My eyes are beastly dim yet,”
said Strange, peering out at some object
a few fields off.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know, it looks like a hump.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Driver, just turn into that lane and
take the south road.—It’s a silo! By Jove!
Old Hopkins is coming on, and look, all
that waste moor under cultivation! I
always said it would grow potatoes.
Seemingly the place is not neglected.
Hopkins was always a good fellow, but
I had no idea until now he wasn’t also
an ass. I dreamt frequently of that
ensilage scheme, someone else has hatched
out my dream for me. Oh Lord, here’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>this shivering on me again! Where’s
the draught?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In your breast-pocket.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell him to wait, I can’t get in
like this, ‘there’s a decency to be observed!’”</p>

<p class='c000'>The driver waited, revolving in his
mind suppositions as to his remarkable
fare, and wondering why “in the devil’s
name” the trap shook as if it had the
palsy.</p>

<p class='c000'>After quite half an hour it stopped and
he had orders to go on, while Strange
mopped the cold sweat from his face with
a trembling hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This degrades a fellow!” he muttered.
As a rule he pulled himself well together
after these attacks, but this time he got
no reaction.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>When they reached the door he was
almost unconscious.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Take me quietly to my den,” he
muttered, “don’t let the servants bother
me.” Then he fainted dead off.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>As</span> he lay in the death-like sleep of
exhaustion that followed his swoon, the
change in Strange was terribly evident.
He had shrunk to half his former size,
his clothes hung in bags on his limp, thin
limbs, his eyes were sunk into deep hollows,
his skin was yellow and puckered,
and his lips were drawn back from his
teeth in a way that told of fever and
thirst.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>When Brydon, with the help of the
panic-stricken servants, had got him to the
sofa, knowing his horror of fuss, he told
them to send at once for the doctor, and
then dismissed them with the utmost
speed—and now he stood at the window
revolving many things, and wondering, if
Strange grew worse, what would happen,
would he send for his wife, and would
she come?</p>

<p class='c000'>“My God! I wish I did not know quite
so much of him,” he muttered, “I wish
he had not, in his ravings, turned himself
inside out in that ghastly way. No man
should know so much of another fellow
as I do of him, it is like eavesdropping.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange moaned, and Brydon crept over
and covered his feet with awkward tenderness,
then he moved softly through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>rooms, looking at the skins and Oriental
stuffs, the colours of which slid into him, and
comforted his soul to some slight extent.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was vaguely fingering a piece of
drapery, when he struck his foot against
the leg of a chair, he looked round
breathlessly to see if he had disturbed
Strange. No—he still slept, and Brydon
continued his purposeless inspection, and,
drawn by some strange coloured texture
he went towards it, and came face to face
with his own bride-picture.</p>

<p class='c000'>He staggered back two or three steps
in a spasm of terror. He had learnt a
deal too much of that picture in Strange’s
ravings, but the overmastering love for
one’s own creation—inherent in God and
man—forced him back to it, and as he
looked, all the past died out, right back to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>that day when he was sitting in Waring
Church, painting, and wiping great sweat-drops
from his face in the ecstasy of knowing
that he had done a great work, and one
that would live for ever.</p>

<p class='c000'>A sudden indefinable sound from the
terrace brought him to himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a queer primitive sound; he felt
somehow that Strange should not hear it, and
went to the window to find out what it was.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently it began again, and ended in
a chuckle, then he caught sight of a flutter
of petticoats around the corner, and could
distinguish a murmur of words. Then a
distinct squeak startled him, and suddenly
a toddling creature appeared on the terrace,
and making a grab at a flower fell
sprawling on its face, and in a fraction of
time was pounced upon by the owner of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>white skirts, who cuddled it to her breast,
with anxious care, but as it only kicked
and crowed she lifted her head from her
kissing. And there within ten paces of
him was his picture made flesh, but with
the sorrow of all ages upon her face.</p>

<p class='c000'>He swayed, put his hand to his head,
then he dropped like a man in a dream
into a chair, and murmured,</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, God! has the earth opened—has
she fallen from Heaven—has—has——”</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked again and the flutter of her
white dress in the sunlight gave to his
dazed, enchanted eyes, the figure of a new
Madonna, before whom the whole world
must kneel and rise up to call her blessed.</p>

<p class='c000'>She came on, still murmuring to her
baby, she came up to the French window,
and put out her hand to open it—then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>the madness fell from Brydon, and the
whole truth came with a rush.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sprang to his feet, cast one perturbed
look at Strange, “Kill him or not, I can’t
face it,” he muttered, and fled.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Gwen got into the room, she
sank wearily into a chair, and throwing
off her hat let the baby butt her at his will.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the smile for her baby flickered
off her face, the final contained anguish
of it was awful, but the child gave her
little time to nurse grief. Every moment
she had either to rock him, croon little
songs to him or tickle him, if she were
silent or passive for a moment a lusty
butt against her breast or a punch from
the pink dimpled fist brought her back
to his service.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she sat—sideways to the window—it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>was impossible for her to see Strange,
but there was nothing to hide her from
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The soft murmur of croons and baby-sounds
at last half awoke him, he lay
for some moments and let the vague
music creep into his semi-consciousness,
then he opened his eyes impatiently
and closed them again—it was only one
more dream, he thought—he was beset
with dreams, tortured, shaken by them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, God! those drugs,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again the murmurs broke on his ears,
there was a chuckle, a tender protesting
voice, and a sharp little squeal. He
shivered and peered out towards the
sounds, his eyes were dimmed from his
great sickness and could only see “men as
trees walking.” Gradually he made out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>the shapes of a woman and a little child.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is it a dream, or death?” he murmured.
“Oh! God, spare me! I am haunted by
delusions.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Another little murmur, and a soft low
sob, it was the woman this time. Again
he opened his eyes and through his dreaming
saw the little yellow-headed child
laughing around the chair, and inviting
the woman to a game of bo-peep.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh! my baby, my own, own baby,” she
broke out, stooping to him, “do you know
what they say—what they din into my
ears, little love, dear baby mine? They
say your father is dead, <em>dead</em>, <span class='fss'>DEAD</span>, dear
one. And must you live, grow up, little
manikin, without knowing what a man he
was?—Sweet, must I sing?—Ah! If you
only knew how it hurts!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>The smile flickered back to her face,
as she took him on her knee, and she
sang a little song he evidently knew well,
for he kicked and crowed by way of
chorus, then he played with his bare toes
for a little—his mother, as she sang, had
pulled off his socks to kiss his feet—and as he
played she returned to her sad soliloquy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will have to take all from me on
trust, little one, and, of course, you will
think I exaggerate, my own, when I tell you
that your mother had the best man that
God yet made or will make, to love her,
to love her.—Ah! what love it was!”
she repeated gently.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then her eyes dreamt, and rested for
a moment, all the pain fled, and her
face shone with radiant triumph and her
mouth trembled like a happy child’s.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“Ah! what love!” she said again; but
instantly all this was swamped in a
mighty wave of pain—she caught her
child and kissed him rather wildly, whispering,
“Baby, she killed this man who
loved her—killed him, baby, because she
was unnatural and couldn’t love—she killed
her mother too, and oh! baby, when in her
loneliness she pleads and prays that God
may let her love Him, He hides His face
from her, and it is all quite just, baby
mine, her mere desert.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah! my own—I can’t sing, I am so tired.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She put him down gently, and looked
before her with sad unseeing eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange struggled to break the spell—to
speak—to move—but he was impotent—paralyzed.
A vague horror—full of sickness
and delirium—had him by the throat.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>He put his hand feebly to his forehead
to brush the sweat away.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is more cruel than death,” he
muttered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile, the baby—being a young
person of an exploring tendency, and loose
on the premises—played havoc with his opportunities.
Having smashed two Venetian
glasses and an atom of old Sèvres, he
perceived his father on the sofa, and toddled
over to investigate him—but so
softly that no notice was taken till
Strange suddenly found a tiny fist thrust
into his mouth, then he started amazedly
and touched the child with quaking awe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then Gwen discovered her loss, ran
a few steps forward with outstretched
hands, and saw the two—Humphrey and
his child.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“Humphrey—Humphrey!” she cried
faintly, tottering towards them—then she
fell at their feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>To Strange it was still a cruel dream—her
falling but part of it. Between the
two, the child stood wondering, then he
caught sight of a diamond on his father’s
finger. He seized on the finger and
dragged it to show his mother, but as
she took no notice, he smacked her face
soundly with his other hand—and simultaneously
the two awoke, he from his
delirium, she from her swoon.</p>

<p class='c000'>And for one moment the two of them
peered at each other through the fog of
a bitter past. Then she sat up slowly,
and looked at his face marvelling above
her, and at his hand caught in her baby’s,
and broke into half incoherent wild explainings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>But suddenly the <a id='con'></a>consciousness that
words could in no sort of way touch her
case, silenced her; she just sat dumbly on
the floor, knowing that she had done evil
in ignorance but that she had come up
through great tribulation into unutterable
joy, full of knowledge, and with a soul
as white as Naaman’s skin. And so—as
best became her—she simply held up her
face to be kissed, while the baby clutched
hold of one of her fingers and one of his
father’s, and in words all his own and
untranslatable, but mightier than those of
gods or churches, decreed that henceforth
and for ever those two should be one
flesh. Which, after all, is the especial
mission of his kind.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br />(<i>Reprinted from Hooks of Steel.</i>)</h3>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>He</span> stopped when he saw us, stopped dead short
on the pavement amidst all the hurrying people.
And as he looked at me and D’Arcy, his face
changed and grew drawn and old with sharp,
sudden misery. I had pierced him to the heart;
in his face I saw it. Sick and cold with shame,
scarce knowing what I did, I shrank back in the
hansom. Only for a moment, but it was a fatal
moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, that’s right, keep back, hide, I’ll protect
you!” called out D’Arcy to me loudly, so loudly
Felix could not fail to hear. Then placing one
hand familiarly on my shoulder, he opened the
trap-door again with his cane and shouted—“Off!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Without an instant’s pause the driver whipped
up his horse and was off as hard as he could go.</p>

<p class='c000'>I recovered myself when I found I was being
borne away from Felix.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“Stop!” I cried wildly, swinging back the doors
in front of me, “let me get out. I must go back!
I must go back to Felix!”</p>

<p class='c000'>D’Arcy leaned forward and hastily swung the
doors together again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You can never go back to Felix,” he said,
seizing me and holding me firmly down in my
seat. “You will have to stay with me instead.
Felix would not have you now. He has caught
you here in London alone with me; <em>he has found
you out</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Appalled by his words and manner, I turned
upon him. His face was still full of malignant
triumph, his small dark eyes burnt as they gazed
into mine, his lips were drawn back from his big
white teeth in a wide grin. It was a full revelation
this time. I knew him as he was; loathsomely,
horribly ugly and wicked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are a fiend!” I cried. “I know you
now. You arranged it all. You deliberately took
me where you knew Felix would see me. It was
a vile plot. I see it all, and I hate you, I hate
you! Do not dare to touch me. Take your hands
off. Let me get out and leave you this instant.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But D’Arcy only held me down more tightly.
I dashed my hand upwards through the opening
in the roof and called to the driver to stop.
“No use,” said D’Arcy. “The man is in my pay.
You may as well sit quiet, Rosamund. I shall
be very kind, you have nothing to fear.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Nearly frantic, I called to a passer-by to help
me. Then D’Arcy shouted to the driver to let
down the glass, and I found myself more straitly
imprisoned than ever. By this time we had left
the Strand far behind us, and were dashing up
quiet side streets, but in what direction I knew
not. It was like a horrible nightmare: on and
on we went, and each step took me more hopelessly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>away from Felix. In vain did I struggle,
in vain did I cry to be set down. The driver
took no notice of my cries, and D’Arcy, still
with that horrible grin on his face, said never
another word, only held me back tightly in the
hansom. I cannot say how long that terrible
drive lasted. My mind throughout was a chaos
of horror and despair.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last, after long hours as it seemed to me,
the hansom stopped, and D’Arcy called to the
man to open the window. We were in the
middle of a broad path bordered with trees, and
all around us was silent dreary park-land. A
drizzle of rain had begun, and beneath the trees
it was already dark with the fast gathering shades
of a winter evening. Here D’Arcy loosened his
hold of me, and instantly I got out. Where to
go and what to do next I knew not, so stood
helplessly in the rain. D’Arcy sat looking at me
for a moment, as if thinking, then got out also.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is the sovereign,” he said, handing up
some money to the driver. The man took it,
glanced at me, and hesitated.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You can go,” said D’Arcy sharply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And leave the young lady in the rain?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you hear? You can go,” repeated D’Arcy,
still more sharply. The man drove away. I felt
too stunned to make any appeal to him. Besides,
of what use? Was it not he who had driven
me on and on, in spite of my cries, until now
miles and miles of unknown streets lay between
me and Felix. If I had been in the middle of
a wilderness, and Felix the other side of the
world, he could not have felt more lost to me
than he did at that moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now, Rosamund,” said D’Arcy, turning to
me and speaking very determinedly, “listen to
reason and be a sensible girl. <em>You have lost Felix.</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>You are not so mad, I suppose, as to imagine he
will have anything further to do with you after
this. You lead a miserable life at the castle, and
it will be still more miserable to go back there
now, for Felix will never visit you any more.
Neither will I come there after you again. I
have had enough of it, I want something better.
So if you go back, you go back to be absolutely
alone with a madman and his keeper. Mark
my words: your uncle is not, and never will be
cured. At his best, he’s as mad as a hatter.
And he’s liable to these attacks of violent madness
which make him absolutely dangerous.
Matthew keeps it dark, but it is not the first
time your uncle has had to go to the asylum by
any means. He’ll break out again as sure as
my name is Leigh, perhaps next time without
any warning. That happened once, so may well
happen again. There’s no method in his madness:
a thoroughly unreliable madman, my friend on
the common calls him. So that’s the companion
you will go home to.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now I have it in my power to offer you a
very happy life. I love you, and I want you
to be my wife. You are just fitted for a London
life, and with your beauty and originality
might make a perfect furore. Now, will you
accept what I offer you and marry me? You
have only to say ‘yes,’ and I will take you
straight to my sister who will act as chaperon
until we can be married: She is a good-natured girl,
and will be glad to oblige me, for many reasons.
Now say, will you marry me? I’ll be awfully
kind to you, Rosamund. After all, you’d have
had a slow time of it with that impecunious Felix.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I had been listening in a dull, stunned way to
this speech, but at his last words an hysterical
passion of anger awoke within me.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>“Marry you! Never! I would rather die,” I
cried. “I know you at last for what you are,
a wicked, plotting fiend!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now, now! No nonsense,” said D’Arcy angrily.
“Remember, Rosamund, you are very
much in my power. You don’t know where you
are, night is coming on, it is raining faster every
minute, and you can’t find your way out of this
place, or get a cab, without me. So give me a
kind answer, and let me take you off to my
sister’s. Come, child, don’t be foolish, we can’t
stand here an hour, getting drenched. Be nice,
I’ve loved you a long time, and been your most
devoted slave, I am sure. Give me a kiss, and
say you’ll come.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never! Keep off! How dare you?” I cried,
trembling with mingled fear and anger.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You needn’t be so very particular. I’ll be
bound you’ve kissed Felix hundreds of times.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Felix! Yes. But you—you!!” Words failed
me. I could find none that would express my
detestation of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He pressed closer, as if determined to kiss me.
Then my passion grew beyond my control. I
seized the cane he was holding in his hand, and
struck him smartly across the face with it. Then
I flung the hateful thing from me amidst the trees.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There!” I cried. “That is to show you how
I loathe and detest you now. Go and pick up
your cane, the cane you used to help you in
your plotting. You have wrecked my life. You
have ruined Felix’s. You have persuaded me to
deceive, and dragged me down to misery. Go,
and never let me see your wicked face again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>D’Arcy made for an instant as if he were
going to strike me in return, but he restrained
himself. “All right,” he said, in a voice trembling
with suppressed rage. “All right, young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>lady. You have given me my <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">congé</span></i>, and I’ll
take it. I don’t feel so anxious to make you
my wife as I did a moment ago. I’d best not
saddle myself with a vixen. I’ll leave you, to
find your way back to the castle. I hope you
will enjoy yourself when you get there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, without another word, he strode away
and left me alone in that strange place in the rain.</p>

<p class='c000'>I waited until he had disappeared in the darkness,
then turned and walked in exactly the
opposite direction, neither thinking nor caring
where I was going, so dulled was I with misery.
But the road went on, and seemed as if it would
never end, and at length I stopped, chilled, wet,
and weary. Then suddenly it occurred to me
that I ought to try and get home; there was
just a faint chance that Felix might go down to
ask what it all meant. At the thought that he
might arrive at the castle, find me still absent,
and imagine me still with D’Arcy, I began to
burn with fever. I turned, and ne’er through
an arch so hurried the blown tide, as I through
the rain and the dark did hurry then. Thinking
it would now be best, I followed the direction
D’Arcy had taken, and after a time came to
some big iron gates. Just as I passed through
them a hansom came driving towards me. My
first impulse was to accost the driver, but I
pulled myself up just when about to speak, for
by the flickering light of the gas-lamp on the
gate I saw it was the man who had driven me
away from Felix. With my head down I hurried
past him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Missy! Missy!” called the man as I passed.
I made no answer. He turned and drove after
me, walking the horse by my side as I pressed
on in the rain. “Missy! Listen. I’m a poor man
with a large family, and that gent is a well-known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>fare of mine so I did not like to go against
him. But I didn’t half like the job. It went
against my conscience a bit, it did, seeing you
so unwilling inside. After I left you, when I’d
got well away, who should I see but the gent
dashing round a corner in another hansom, with
a bad sort of look on him, and, dashed if I could
go on, for thinking of the helpless looking young
thing I left with him in the rain. So back I came
again, just to see what had become of you. And
now, Missy, if I can make up to you by driving
you anywhere, say the word and jump in, and
there you shall go.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So lost and wretched did I feel, and so consuming
was my desire to get home, I could not
refuse the offer. The man helped to bring about
my misery, but, if I sent him away now, where
should I go, what should I do, in this great
unknown city? I climbed in, feeling utterly spent.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where to?” asked the man, peering down
through the now horribly familiar trap-door.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, take me home, take me home!” I half
moaned in answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, Missy, don’t you fret, I’ll take you home.
But where is it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“On Wildacre Common.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Phew! That’s a long way off. I can’t drive
you to Wildacre, but I’ll drive you to Waterloo,
and you’ll get a train there easy that’ll take you
straight to Wildacre.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He flicked his whip and started. I do not know
what streets we passed through, but again I seemed
to drive through miles and miles of them. The
rain poured down upon the pavements, which
shone in murky glossiness beneath the gas-lamps.
The people flitted past like black ghosts, beneath
the shade of their dripping umbrellas. This was
the gay city, the city of my dreams. I had envied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Felix his life in this city; I had risked my life’s
happiness to spend one day in it. And, behold!
its pleasures had turned to ashes in my mouth,
and its light into horrible murky darkness.
It was a miserable city, a terrible city, a
city that made one feel fearfully, utterly alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>We reached Waterloo at last, and my driver
called a porter and asked him to attend to me.
Then he drove off instantly, and not until afterwards
did I remember that he had gone without
even asking for his fare. The porter escorted
me to the right platform, but there we found
a train to Wildacre had just gone, and there
would be no other for thirty-five minutes. I
sat down in my wet things upon a bench, and
waited with feverish impatience, whilst the clock
overhead lagged through the interminable minutes.
Then what D’Arcy had said came true. Strange
horrible men came up and spoke to me. I sat
mute, and answered never a word, and my
heart sickened with longing for Felix. The porter
came for me when the time was up, and put me
into the train, and smiled gratefully at me when
I gave him half-a-crown. All through the
journey to Wildacre I sat in a kind of stupor,
only waking from it when people got in and out
at the stations, or when a train whizzed past
on its way up to London. Then came the drive
up the hill and across the common. It was very
cold on the common. The rain had now ceased
to fall, and the wind cut my face like a knife,
but I was too weary to pull up the cab windows.
By the little sunken fence I dismissed the cab,
and walked in the darkness across the lawn to the
honeysuckle porch. A flood of light greeted me
as I opened the door, and Anne Gillotson rushed
out of the dining-room looking white and agitated.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh! I <em>am</em> glad to see you safely back again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>Miss,” she said. “It is going on for ten o’clock,
and I have been so anxious about you ever
since it became dark. Mr. Felix Gray has been
here. He arrived about nine o’clock, but when
he found you were out he did not stay.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I stood still in the hall, and a deadly sick
feeling came over me. “Did he ask where I
was?” I managed to say.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, Miss. Oh, please don’t look like that,”
replied Anne, almost weeping. “I hope you’ll
forgive me, but he was so stern and asked such
sharp questions I was obliged to tell him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You told him——?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I told him that you had said you were going
to spend the day with an old schoolfellow who
was staying near here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, dear! Miss, I am more vexed than I
can say that it should have happened, for he
looked in a dreadful way and went straight out
at the door. I begged him to wait, but he said
there would be no use in waiting. Then he
changed his mind and came in again, and said
he’d leave a note for you. I got him pen and
paper and he wrote a short note. ‘Give her this,’
he said, ‘when she returns, if she ever does
return.’ Then he went away. He has not been
gone half an hour, Miss, if you’d only been a
little bit earlier you’d have caught him. My
dear, how wet you are, and how white you
look; what does it all mean?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where is the note?” I gasped.</p>

<p class='c000'>She went into the dining-room and brought
it out to me. I tore it open. There were but
two words written on the paper:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good-bye, Rosamund.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the end. Upon me had been laid
the punishing hand of God.</p>

  <h3 class='c016'>CHAPTER V.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Not</span> Ariadne passioning for Theseus’ flight ever
felt such grief as mine was then. Felix must
have gone back to town in one of the trains that
whizzed past mine as I made the dreadful journey
home. I had lost my last chance by missing
that earlier train at Waterloo. Thirty-five minutes
earlier, and we should not have whizzed past
each other in silent misery, and I might have
been saved. If only I could have seen him! I
should have thrown myself upon his bosom, and
clung to him and entreated him. I should have
poured out to him the whole story of my wickedness
and my sorrow, have forced him to believe
in my remorse and my love. I would have held
him fast and never let him go. And he who
loved me so much, seeing my misery, seeing my
real love, would have been unable to tear himself
away. But now, he had gone, he had said
good-bye, and all was over. I staggered where
I stood, and the frightened dressmaker came over
to me and supported me. There was no strength
left in me any more. She led me upstairs, and
took off my wet things, and put me to bed like
a baby.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mute and unresisting I let her do as she would
with me. Then she fetched the charwoman to
light my fire, and they whispered together, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>through my chilled stupor I could feel both were
full of deep concern. They brought me some
hot drink later on, and I drank it after they had
implored me long, drank it just to be left in
peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>All through the night I lay there, cold, quiet,
stupid. There had come upon me a frost, a
killing frost, and dead were the tender leaves
of hope. Sleep fled far away, and left me a
watcher of mine own heart’s sorrow. My bright
day was done. I was for the dark; and no
glimpse was given to me, as to Charmian, of
the far-off break in the clouds, and the eastern
star.</p>

<p class='c000'>Never once during the miserable Sunday that
followed that endless night did I leave the house.
I feared lest by some chance Felix might come
back and find me again absent. All the day
long I watched from the window, straining my
eyes across the wide common even after light
had waned. Vain effort! No dark figure came
towards me, such as I had seen many a time
before when waiting eagerly for Felix.</p>

<p class='c000'>A second night. Again no sleep came near
me. I think I was touched with madness that
second night. Whenever I closed my eyes I
saw the wide dreary common, and far away a
dark figure which came on and on, yet never
drew nearer. On the Monday, although I knew
it would be a fruitless watch, I again set myself
to stare out of the window across the common.
When the luncheon hour approached Anne came
and forcibly drew me away.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Miss Gwynne,” she said, “I really must not
allow you to go on like this any longer. You
will have a serious illness. Will you not tell
me what is wrong? Do, dear child; in some way
I might be able to help. When we are in trouble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>we never know from what quarter help may
come. Tell me, tell me, dear!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have lost Felix,” I said, breaking down
suddenly into wild sobs. “I have lost Felix.
He has said good-bye to me. He will never
come back to me again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh! my dear, I hope it is not so bad as
that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hope! There is no hope. I have been guilty
of a base and cruel sin, and this is my punishment.
God is punishing me: there is no hope
when He punishes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, my dear! don’t say that. I think there
is more hope than when man does. Let us try
to do something better for you than staring out
of that window. Can’t we go after Mr. Felix?
He’s so fond of you I am sure if he could see
your poor changed face he’d forgive you anything!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Could there yet be hope? Oh, Eastern Star!
are you there, behind the clouds? My heart beat
wildly at the thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes! let us do that, let us go at once after
Felix,” I cried, a fever of impatience rising within
me, and taking the place of the cold numbness
which had possessed me before.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well,” said Anne, “we will go, but
not until you have eaten a solid luncheon. I will
take no step from here until you have done that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I saw by her face she was determined, so
followed her into the dining-room. So deep a
horror did I now feel of the great city, I had
not the courage to start off by myself. I forced
some solid food down my throat, the barouche
was ordered, and in half an hour we were on
the weary way to London. It was half past two
when we reached Waterloo. Two days ago
the place had breathed to me of pleasant anticipation,
now it was full of distressing associations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>The bench against the wall wore a terrible
look of familiarity, so did the loungers who
stared at me on the wide platform. The face of
the clock was as the face of an inexorable enemy.
“Too late,” it had said to me when I was striving
to hasten away from London, and then it
had lagged through the minutes which lost me
Felix. “Too late,” it said now to my anxious
heart, when I was hastening back. It seemed
to me ages before we could get a cab, and again
did miles and miles of streets seem to lie twixt
me and my goal.</p>

<p class='c000'>I flew up the stairs when I reached the house
where Felix lodged, on and on towards the top
where he had often said he lived. The first door
I came to I opened. The room within was small
and had a deserted look. A fire was dying in
the grate, pieces of brown paper and lengths of
twine lay about on the floor. One who had
inhabited it had been packing there and had gone.
Flushing all over with almost unbearable misery
I tore at the bell. The landlady had been following
me upstairs, and entered now with Anne.
A stout woman with a big pale face and dark
eyes that looked curiously at me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are too late if you want to see Mr.
Gray,” she said. “He has just left. He gave
up these rooms suddenly and has gone abroad to
join a relation; his grandmother, I think he said.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As she spoke her face seemed to me to change,
and to become enormously big and white like
that of my inexorable enemy the clock. I think
I was near swooning at that moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Has he left any address?” asked Anne,
divining by instinct the question I had not strength
to put myself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“None whatever. He made up his mind very
suddenly; in fact I don’t think on Saturday he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>had any intention of going abroad at all. I
heard nothing of it until Sunday at any rate.
All yesterday he was very busy arranging his
affairs, and this morning he paid his bill, and a
week’s rent instead of notice. He took everything
away with him and said he should not be
returning. Poor gentleman! He looked very ill.
There was some trouble I am sure, but he was
not one to talk about himself. I’m sorry I can’t
give you his address, but he gave me no hint of
where he was going any more than of why he
was going. All I know for certain is that he
drove off to catch the club train, 3 P.M. from
Victoria. Perhaps if you drove after him at once
you might be just in time to say good-bye. You
are not far from Victoria Station here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Strength came back to me at this suggestion.
“Come,” I cried, seizing hold of Anne’s cloak,
and almost dragging her out of the room. Almost
as excited as I, she rushed after me down the
stairs, and a moment later we were tearing along
the streets to Victoria. We wasted five precious
minutes by going first to an utterly wrong part
of the station. I was nearly frantic when I discovered
this mistake, and no porter seemed to
have time to attend to us. At length a gentleman
took pity on our helplessness, and offered us his
services.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The club train, for going abroad—I must
catch it,” I said feverishly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are on quite a wrong platform. This is
the Brighton and South Coast line, you want the
London, Chatham, and Dover. I doubt if you’ll
catch the club train, but we’ll see. Follow me—this
way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We followed quickly where he led but it seemed
a long way from the one line to the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah! Just in time! There’s your train!” exclaimed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>our guide when at last we reached the
right platform.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yes, there it was, just a little ahead, to the
right. I ran wildly forward, my heart beating
almost to suffocation. The others followed me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, by Jove! Hard luck, the train’s off!”
exclaimed the stranger-friend behind me.</p>

<p class='c000'>My knees trembled beneath me and I came
suddenly to a full stop.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And there he is!” screamed Anne. “Oh, look
Miss, in that saloon carriage, bending down. Oh,
somebody, stop the train!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Just for an instant, as the train sped by, I
caught sight of Felix. A desolate man in a grey
suit sitting by the window with his face buried
in his hands. Oh! why did he not look up and
see me standing there in helpless misery? Only
for an instant was I given this last glimpse of
my lover, then I found myself gazing at the back
of the departing train.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” cried Anne, wringing
her hands. “How unfortunate to miss him again
and by so little. You are just too late every
time. I never saw such hard luck.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” I said, feeling quite numb with despair,
“not hard luck. It is the punishing hand, the
punishing hand which has kept me back every
time. It is no use to struggle against the punishing
hand. Take me home, Anne, take me home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She took me home. Good kind woman, she
would not let me succumb to despair. The whole
way back she kept telling me that Matthew
would be with me that evening, and that he
would be surely able to do something, he was so
clever. So constantly did she give me this
assurance that at length I began to believe in
it a little myself. A faint hope crept back into
my heart. Matthew might yet save me, Matthew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>who was so clever, so ingenious, so full of
resource; Matthew who was such an experienced
man, who had such a wonderful talent for knowing
the right thing to do in a difficulty. If anyone
in the world could help me, surely Matthew
could. I dwelt upon this thought until it grew
and grew in my mind, and became a conviction
that Matthew was to save me. How, I knew
not, unless by following Felix over the world
himself, but somehow he was to save me.</p>

<p class='c000'>I watched for his coming as a drowning man
watches for a spar which the waves are tossing
to his side. Two hours after our return from
London he came, with his master. The barouche
drove up gaily to the door, and the two men
got out, both looking radiant. This was the hour
to which two days ago I had so looked forward,
and now it was all I could do to come forward
and greet the home-comers at all, so unbearable
was my grief and anxiety.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah! Here she is! Here’s the Valkyrie!”
cried my uncle, skipping up to me, spotless, fresh,
and bland as ever. “My dear, I have much
pleasure in shaking hands with you again. It is
most pleasant to return to the castle, and to feel
I am once more on my own property. Not that
I haven’t enjoyed my visit immensely. Of course
you know that I’ve been on a pleasant visit,
don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Here he peered sharply and suspiciously into
my face. Matthew gave me a nudge. I knew
what it meant. I was to ignore the lunatic asylum,
and converse with my uncle as if he had simply been
away on a visit. The old insupportable life was
beginning again; beginning again without Felix.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&trade;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away&mdash;you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&trade; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the
Foundation&rdquo; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&trade;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&trade; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&trade; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&trade; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&trade; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&trade; work (any work

phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

Gutenberg&trade; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&trade; work in a format
other than &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&trade; web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&trade; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&trade; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&trade; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

        You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&trade;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&trade;
        works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&trade; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

or any Project Gutenberg&trade; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&trade; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
